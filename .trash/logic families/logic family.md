a logic family of monolithic [[integrated circuit]][[digital circuit]] devices is a group of electronic [[logic gates]] constructed using one of several different designs, usually with compatible [[logic level]] and power supply  characteristics within a family

many logic families were produced as individual components, each containing one or a few related basic [[logic function]], which could be used as "building-blocks" to create systems or as so-called "glue" to interconnect more complex integrated circuits

the most common logic family in modern [[semiconductor devices]] is [[CMOS logic]], due to low power consumption, small transistor sizes and high transistor density
