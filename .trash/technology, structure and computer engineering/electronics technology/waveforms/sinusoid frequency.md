like [[waveform frequency]] pulsatance $\omega\ =2\pi T\ = 2\pif$, expressed in rad/s, represents an angular variation over time since the signal runs along an angle of $2Ï€$radians for each time period $T$. 
the angular frequency is also defined as the rate of change of the phaseof a sinusoidal waveform, or as the rate of change of the argument of the sine function
