applying the definition of [[waveform root mean square value]] we obtain
$$X_{ef}=X_{RMS}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\int^T_0{[X_msin(\omega t)]^2} dt}=$$
$$=\sqrt{\frac{2}{T}\int_0^\frac{T}{2}{[X_msin(\omega t)]^2} dt}=$$
$$=\frac{X_m}{\sqrt 2}$$
The RMS value depends only on the maximum value $X_m$, being independent from its frequency and its phase offset. When referring to a sinusoidal signal, we will assume that a voltage value will correspond to its RMS value unless stated otherwise

for the case of composite sinusoidal functions defined as $x(t) =X_{DC}+X_msin(ωt+φ)$,their RMS value is given by:
$$\sqrt{X_c^2+\frac{X_m^2}{2}}$$
