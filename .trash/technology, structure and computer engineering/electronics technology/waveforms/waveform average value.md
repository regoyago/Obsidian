the waveform average value or DC offset $X_{DC}$ or $X_c$ represents the average of the instantaneous values during a time [[waveform period]] $T$
it is obtained mathematically by computing the arithmetic mean of those instantaneous values [^1]
$$X_{DC}=X_C=\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}x(t)dt$$

[^1]:the average value consists in computing the area under the curve $x(t)$ for the time interval $0≤t≤T$ and divide the obtained value by $T$. The values corresponding to such areas are positive whenthe curve is above the time axist, and negative otherwise. Therefore, all waveforms that are symmetric withrespect to the horizontal axis exhibit an average value equal to zero
