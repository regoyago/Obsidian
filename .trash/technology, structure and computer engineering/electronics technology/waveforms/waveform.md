a waveform or a signal, denoted as $x(t)$ is a [[mathematical function]] describing a [[physical magnitude]] that changes over time
according to this definition, DC waveforms such as [[electric potential]] or [[electric current]] could not be treated as waveforms since they are constant over time, but they are typically treated as particular cases of signals known as continuous-time signals

based on its variation over time, functions can be:
- [[aperiodic function]]: the signal values do not repeat in a periodic fashion, hence a time interval from which the signal repeats will never be found
- [[periodic function]]: the signal values repeat in a periodic fashion

the most important parameters of a given function are the following
[[waveform instantaneous value]]
[[waveform period]]
[[waveform frequency]]
[[waveform peak value]]
[[waveform amplitude]]
[[waveform ripple]]
[[waveform average value]]
[[waveform root mean square value]]
