we denote as direct-current ideal current generator (or simply direct-current ideal generator or direct-current ideal source) to a generator that keeps constant the [[electric current intensity]] flowing through its terminals, independently from the voltage difference [[electric potential]] between its terminals. such a current intensity is known as the electromotive current of the generator.

its [[dual]] com is the [[dc voltage source]]

in an ideal current generator the current that flows through its terminals is $I=I_g$, independently from the voltage between its terminals. if we connect a load resistor $R_L$ to the current generator
then a [[electric current]] with a constant intensity $I$ will flow through it, thus the voltage between its terminals will be given by:

$$V=R_L.I=R_L.I_g$$

the power delivered by the current generator to the resistor load is $P=I^2·R_L=V·I$ current generator delivers power to the circuit when the voltage difference between the positive and the negative terminal is positive
when the current generator is connected to an external circuit consisting of other generators, it is possible that such a voltage difference between the positive and the negative terminals becomes negative
in this case, the power delivered by the current generator is given by $P=(−V)·I=−V·I$ thus the current generator is actually not delivering power, but consuming it

analogously to [[dc voltage source]] all current generators are actually real, hence the current that flows through their terminals depends on the voltage difference between their terminals, thus the higher the voltage, the smaller the current the generator can sustain through its terminals. in the limit, if the circuit between the terminals of a current generator is an open circuit, then no current can flow through its terminals $(I= 0)$, and the resulting voltage difference between the terminals of the current generators is the maximum voltage the generator can deliver and is denoted as $V_{ca}$. 
this reduction can be modeled as an internal resistor $R_g$ connected in parallel to the current generator $I_g$. Therefore, a real current generator
