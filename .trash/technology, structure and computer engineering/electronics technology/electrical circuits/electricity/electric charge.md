electric charge is the physical property of [[subatomic particle]] that causes it to experience a [[electric force]] when placed in the [[electric field]]
the electric charge can be positive ([[proton]]) or negative ([[electron]])
the electric charge is measured in [[coulomb]]s

electric charge is a conserved property; the net charge (amount of positive minus negative charge) of an isolated system, cannot change 

charge is quantified; it comes in [[integer number]] multiples of individual small units called [[elementary charge]] ($e$), about $1.602*10^{-19} \ \ C$ which is the smallest charge which can exist freely [^1] 
the proton has a charge of $+e$ and the [[electron]] $-e$

[^1]: [[quarks]] have smaller charges, multiples of $\frac{1}{3}e$, but they are only found in combination to form particles with integer charge
