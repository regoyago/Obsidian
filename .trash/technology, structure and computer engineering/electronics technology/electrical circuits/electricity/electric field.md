the electric [[field]] is defined as the region of space in which the [[electric force]] interacts

this field can be measured taking its definition as the [[force]] that interacts with an unit of positive [[electric charge]]
formally:
$$\vec{E}=\frac{\vec{F}}{q}=\frac{K*\frac{q_1*q_2}{r^2}}{q}=K*\frac{q_1}{r^2} \ N/C$$
	/	/ the formula for [[electric force]] is used
	/	/ the field is measured in [[newtons]] over [[coulombs]]
	
	
it can be represented graphically as [[field lines]] following:
- they are open lines going from the positive [[electric charge]] towards infinity or from infinity towards the negative [[electric charge]]
- the number of lines is proportional to the [[electric charge]]
- if it is an [[uniform field]], the lines will be paralell

we can determine the relative direction and sense of $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{F}$ by knowing the sign of the charge:
- if positive, the will both be equal
- if negative, they share direction but have opposite senses
