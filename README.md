NOTE: this is still a WIP and probably won't be finished in a long time

my personal computer science notes!
the material is gathered from my compsci lectures and completed with information from other sources:
    from some books, webpages ranging from universities to wikipedia, or even youtube >-<
please note that even though all the notes are in english, some matematical notation is based upon spanish mathematics

### overview

the current state of my notes is:

computer science
- algorithms
    - complexity theory
- artificial intelligence
    - neural networks
- maths
    - discrete mathematics
    - algebra
    - calculus
    - formal systems 

(i had more notes, but decided to start anew since they were really chaothic)

### application
the app i use is called [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), overall all files should be text written using markdown syntax, with the exception that references to other files are written as \[\[\<name>\]\] that may be cumbersome if reading as plain text, but on obsidian it works as a link to the file, easing review and linking concepts more clearly, so i wholeheartedly recommend to open this files with obsidian
