# obsidian
these are my computer science notes
i use an app called obsidian

every file could be treated as a .txt, but some things are lost:
- all the links between different note files are written as double square brackets
- everything wrote down using LaTeX is $<formulas>$
  
this repo includes both the notes per se and the config files of the app
