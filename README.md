NOTE: this is still a WIP and probably won't be finished in a long time

my personal computer science notes!
the material is gathered from my compsci lectures and completed with information from other sources:
    from some books, webpages, even youtube >-<

the overview is still kinda messy and incomplete:
- computer-science
    - mathematics
    - algorithms
    - artificial intelligence

(i had more notes, but decided to start anew since they were really chaothic)

the app i use is called obsidian[https://obsidian.md/], overall all files should be text written
using markdown syntax, with the exception that references to other files are written as [[<name>]]
that may be cumbersome if reading as plain text, but on obsidian it works as a link to the file,
easing review and linking concepts more clearly, so i wholeheartedly recommend to open this notes
with obsidian
