in mathematics, the graph of a [[mathematical function]] is the set of ordered pairs $(x,y)$, where $f(x)=y$

these pairs are the [[cartesian coordinates]] of points in the  [[plane]]

in the case of functions of two variables, that is, functions whose [[domain]] consists of pairs $(x,y)$, the graph usually refers to the set of ordered triples $(x,y,z)$ where $f(x,y)=z$ instead of the pairs $((x,y),z)$ as the definition above
this set is a subset of three dimensional space, a [[surface]]

the graph of a function is a special case of a [[binary relation]]
