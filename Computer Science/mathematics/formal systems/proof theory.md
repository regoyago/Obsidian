proof theory is a major branch of [[mathematical logic]] that represents proofs as formal mathematical objects facilitating their analysis by mathematical techniques

proofs are typically presented as inductively defined data structures such as [[list]]s or [[tree]]s, constructed according to the [[axiom]]s and [[inference rules]] of the [[formal system]]
