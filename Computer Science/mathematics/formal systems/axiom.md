an axiom, postulate or assumption, is a statement that is taken to be true to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments [^1]

the term has subtle differences in definition when used in the context of different fields of study, but in modern [[mathematical logic]], an axiom is a premise or starting point for reasoning

as used in mathematics, he term axiom is used in two related but distinguishable senses:
- logical axioms: statements that are taken to be true within the [[formal system]] they define and are often shown in symbolic form
- non-logical axioms: substantive assertions about the elements of the domain of a specific mathematical theorem

[^1]:  the word comes from the greek axíōma (ἀξίωμα) 'that which is thought worthy or fit' or 'that which commends itself as evident'
