in [[set theory]], a set is said to be a well-defined collection of objects which can be distinguished from each other
the elements conforming a set are said to be elements of that set 
if the collection has no elements, it is said that the set is empty, generally denoted with $\emptyset$ or $\{\}$
sets are defined by the list of all its elements, or by the rules that determine their elements both must be written inside brackets "{}"

sets are usually denoted by latin uppercase letters $A,B,\ldots$ and its elements by latin lowercase letter $a,b,\ldots$
if the element $a$ is known to be part of the set $A$, it is said that $a$ belongs to $A$, mathematically: $a\in A$

some examples of sets in mathematics are $\mathbb N$, the [[natural number]]s, $\mathbb Z$, the [[integer number]]s, $\mathbb Q$,  the [[rational number]]s, $\mathbb R$, the [[real number]]s and $\mathbb C$, the [[complex number]]s
