in [[set theory]], a super is a [[set]] that contains all the elements of another, that is:

$A$ is a superset of $B$ if all the contents of $B$ are contained in $A$

$A$ and $B$ can be equal, if they are not, $A$ is said to be a proper superset of $A$, this can be checked comparing the [[cardinality]] of each

the [[relation]] of one set being a subset of another is called [[inclusion]] or containment and is represented by $\supset$

if $A$ and $B$ are sets and every element of $B$ is also in $A$
- $A$ is a superset of $B$ denoted by $A \supseteq B$
if $A$ is a superset of $B$ but $A$ is not equal to $B$ then:
- $A$ is a proper superset of $B$, denoted by $A\supset B$
- the [[empty set]] cant be the superset of any set $X$
