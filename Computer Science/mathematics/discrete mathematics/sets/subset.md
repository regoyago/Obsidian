in [[set theory]], a subset is a [[set]] whose elements are contained in another, that is:

$B$ is a subset of $A$ if all of its elements are contained inside $A$

$A$ and $B$ can be equal, if they are not, $B$ is said to be a proper subset of $A$, this can be checked comparing the [[cardinality]] of each

the [[relation]] of one set being a subset of another is called [[inclusion]] or containment and is represented by $\subset$

if $A$ and $B$ are sets and every element of $A$ is also in $B$
- $A$ is a subset of $B$ denoted by $A \subseteq B$
if $A$ is a subset of $B$ but $A$ is not equal to $B$ then:
- $A$ is a proper subset of $B$, denoted by $A\subset B$
- the [[empty set]] is a subset of any set $X$ and a proper subset of any except itself
