in [[set theory]], for any set $S$ the inclusion [[relation]] $\subseteq$ is a [[partial order]] on the set $P(S)$ (the [[power set]] of  $S$- the set of all [[subset]]s of $S$) defined by $a\leq B \iff A\subsetew B$

we may also partially order $P(S)$ by reverse set inclusion by defining $A\leq B$ if and only if $B\subseteq A$
when quantified, $A\subseteq B$ is represented as $\forall x (x\in A \implies x\in B)$

proof:
- suppose that $a$ is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of $A$
- show that $a$ is an element of $B$
