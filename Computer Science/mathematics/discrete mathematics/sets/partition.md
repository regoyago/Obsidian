in [[set theory]], a partition of a [[set]] is a grouping of its elements into non-empty [[subset]]s, in such a way that every element is included in exactly one subset

every [[equivalence relation]] on a set defines a partition and viceversa
a set equipped with an equivalence elation or a partition is sometimes called a setoid

a parititon of a set $X$ is a set of non-empty subsets of $X$ such that every element $x$ in $X$ is in exactly one of these subsets
equivalently, a family of sets[^1] $P$ is a partition of $X$ if and only if all of the following conditions hold:
- the family $P$ does not contain the [[empty set]]
- the [[union]] of the sets in $P$ is equal to $P$
- the intersection of any two distinct sets in $P$ is empty
