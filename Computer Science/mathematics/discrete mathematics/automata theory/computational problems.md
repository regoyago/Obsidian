in [[theoretical computer science]], a computational problem is a problem that a [[computer]] might be able to solve, or a question that a computer may be able to solve

a computational problem can be viewed as a [[set]] of instances or cases together with a, possibly empty set of solutions for every instance/case

computational problems are one of the main objects or study in theoretical computer science
the field of [[computational complexity theory]] attempts to determine the amount of resources ([[computational complexity]]) solving a given problem will require and explain why some problems may not be solvable

computational problems belong to [[computational classes]] that define broadly the resources it takes to compute / solve them with various [[abstract machine]]s
