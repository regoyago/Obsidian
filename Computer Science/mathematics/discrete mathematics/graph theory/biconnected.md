in [[graph theory]] a biconnected graph is a connected an nonseparable [[graph]], meaning that if any one [[vertex]] were to be removed, the graph will remain connected, that is, it is a graph that has no [[articulation vertex]]

- a biconnected undirected [[graph]] is a connected graph that is not broken into disconnected pieces by deleting any single vertex
- a biconnected [[directed graph]] is one such that for any two vertices $v, w$, there are two directed paths from $v$ to $w$ which have no vertices in common other than $v$ and $w$
