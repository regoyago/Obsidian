in mathematics, more specifically in [[graph theory]], a graph is a structure amounting to a [[set]] of objects in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense "related"[^1]

formally, we can define a graph as an [[ordered pair]] $G = (V,E)$ where $V$ is the set whose elements are called [[node]]s and $E$ that set of paired vertices ([[edge]]s)
sometimes, graphs are allowed to contain [[edge loop]]s

the objects correspond to mathematical abstractions called [[node]]s
and each of the related pairs of nodes is called a [[edge]]

typically, a graph is depicted in diagrammatic form as a set of dots joined by lines

the edges may be directed or undirected, differentiating between [[undirected graph]]s and [[directed graph]]s

two different measures have to be made when talking about graphs: [[graph order]] and [[graph size]]
