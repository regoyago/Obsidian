in [[graph theory]], a complete graph is a [[graph]] in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique [[edge]]

it has the following properties:
-  the complete graph on $n$ vertices is denoted by $K_n$
- $K_n$ has $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ edges and is a [[regular graph]] of degree $n-1$
- all complete graphs are maximally connected 
- if the edges of a complete graph are each given an orientation, the resulting [[directed graph]] is a [[tournament]]
