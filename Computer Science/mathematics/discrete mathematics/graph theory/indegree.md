in [[graph theory]],  given a [[vertex]] $v$, the indegree is the number of head ends adjacent to the $v$

let $G=(V,A)$ and $v\in V$ the indegree of $v$ is denoted $deg^-(v)$

a vertex with $deg^-(v)=0$ is called a source and it is the origin of each of its outcoming arcs

the degree sum formula states that , for a directed graph

$$\sum_{v\in V}deg^-(v)=\sum_{v\in V}deg ^+(v) = |A|$$
if for every vertex $v\in V$, $deg^+(v) = deg ^-(v)$, then the graph is called a balanced directed graph
