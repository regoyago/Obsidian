in [[graph theory]], a hypergraph is a generalization of a [[graph]] in which an [[edge]] can join any number of [[vertex]]

formally, an undirected hypergraph $H$ is a pair $H=(X,E)$ where $X$ is a [[set]] of vertices and $E$ a set of nonempty [[subset]]s of $X$

therefore, $E$ is a [[subset]] $P(X)\backslash {\emptyset}$, where $P(X)$ is the [[power set]] of $X$
