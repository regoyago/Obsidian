in [[graph theory]], an edge is one of the basic units out of which graphs are constructed
each edge has two [[vertex]] to which it is attached, called its endpoints

edges may be directed or undirected, generally, the edges of [[directed graph]]s are called [[arc]]s

when the two elements that an edge "relates[^1]" are the exact same, that edge is referred to as loops[^2]
