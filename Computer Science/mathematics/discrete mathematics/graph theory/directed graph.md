in mathematics, , more specifically in [[graph theory]], a directed graph or digraph is a [[graph]] that is made up of a [[set]] of [[vertex]]s connected by [[arc]]s

in formal terms, a directed graph is an [[ordered pair]] $G=(V,A)$, where
- $V$ is a [[set]] whose elements are called vertices or nodes
- $A$ is a set of [[ordered pair]]s of vertices, called arcs

it differs from ordinary [[graph]]s in that the latter is defined in terms of unordered pairs of vertices, usually called [[edge]]s

the aforementioned definition does not allow a directed graph to have multiple arrow with the same source and target vertices, bu some authors consider a broader definition that allows directed graphs to have such multiple arcs
more specifically, these entities are addressed as directed [[multigraph]]s

on the other hand, the aforementioned definition allows a directed graph to have edge loops
