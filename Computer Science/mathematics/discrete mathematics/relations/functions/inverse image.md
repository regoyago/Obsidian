in mathematics, the preimage of a [[mathematical function]] is the [[set]] of all elements of the [[domain]] that map to the members of $B$


let $f$ be a function from $X$ to $Y$ the preimage or inverse image of a [[set]] $B\subseteq Y$ under $f$, denoted by $f^{-1}[B]$ is the subset of $X$ defined by

$$f^{-1}[B] = {x\in X : f(x)\in B}$$
