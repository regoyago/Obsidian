in mathematics, an identity function, is a [[mathematical function]] that always returns the same value that was used as its input

formally, if $M$ is a [[set]] the identity function $f$ on $M$ is defined to be that function with [[domain]] and [[codomain]] $M$ which satisfies

$f(X) = X$ for all elements $X$ in $M$ 

in other words, the function value $f(X)$ in $M$ is always the same input element $X$ of $M$ (that is, the [[codomain]] is the same as the [[domain]])
