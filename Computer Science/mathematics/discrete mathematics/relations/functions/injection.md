in mathematics, an injective function, also known as injection is a [[mathematical function]] that maps distinct elements to distinct elements, that is $f(x_1)=f(x_2)\implies x_1=x_2$

in other words, every element of the function's [[codomain]] is the [[image]] of at most one element of its [[domain]]

$\forall a,b \in X, f(a) = f(b) \implies a = b$
which is logically equivalent[^1]  to the [[logical contraposition]]
$\forall a,b \in X, a\neq b \implies f(a)\neq f(b)$
