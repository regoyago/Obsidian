in mathematics an [[homogeneous binary relation]] $R$ on a [[set]] $X$ is reflexive if it relates every element of $X$ to itself

formally:
the relation $R$ is called reflexive if $x\ R\ x$ for every $x \in X$

or equivalently if $I_x\subseteq R$, where $I_x:=\{(x,x):x\in X\}$ denotes the [[identity relation]] on $X$
