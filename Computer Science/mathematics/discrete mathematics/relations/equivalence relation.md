in mathematics, an equivalence relation is a [[binary relation]] that is reflexive, symmetric and transitive

each equivalence relation provides a [[partition]] of the underlying [[set]]into disjoint [[equivalence class]]

two elements of a given set are equivalent to each other if and only if they belong to the same equivalence class

an equivalence relation is generally represented by the symbol $\sim$

formal definition:
a binary relation $\sim$ on a set $X$ is said to be an equivalence relation if and only if, for all $a,b,c \in X$:
- $a \sim a$ ([[reflexive relation]])
- $a \sim b \iff b\sim a$ ([[symmetric relation]]) 
- if $a\sim b$ and $b\sim c$ then $a\sim c$ ([[transitive relation]])

$X$ together with the relation $\sim$ is called a [[setoid]]
