in mathematics, a [[binary relation]] on a [[set]] is called connected or total if it relates / compares all distinct pairs of elements of the set one direction or another

formally, a relation $R$ on a set $X$ is called connected when for all $x, y \in X$
$$\text{if } x\neq y \text{ then } x\ R\ y \ \text{or}\ y\ R \ x$$
or, equivalently, when for all $x, y \in X$
$$x\ R \ y \ \text{ or }\ y\ R \ r \ \text{ or }\ x = y$$
its a less restrictive version of a [[strongly connected relation]]

connectedness features prominently in the definition of [[total order]]s
