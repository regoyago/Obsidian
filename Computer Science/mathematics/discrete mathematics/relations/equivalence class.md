in mathematics, when the elements of some [[set]] $S$ have a notion of equivalence[^1] defined on them, then one may naturally split the set $S$ into equivalence classes 

these equivalence classes are constructed so that elements $a$ and $b$ belong to the same equivalence class if and only if they are equivalent

formally, given a set $S$ and an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $S$, the equivalence class of an element $a$ in $S$ denoted by $[a]$ is the set
$$x\in S : x\sim a$$
of elements which are equivalent to $a$

it may be proven from defining properties of equivalence relations, that the equivalence classes form a [[partition]] of $S$
