in mathematics, a finitary relation over [[set]]s $X_1,\ldots X_n$ is a [[subset]] of the [[cartesian product]] $X_1\times \ldots \times X_n$, that is, a set of $n$ [[tuple]]s $(x_1,\ldots x_n)$ consisting of elements $x_i\in X_i$

typically the relation describes a possible connection between the elements of an n-tuple

the non-negative integer $n$ giving the number of "places" in the relation is called the [[arity]] 

an n-ary relation over sets $X_1,\ldots ,X_n$ is an element of the [[power set]] of $X_1\times \ldots \times X_n$

given the [[set]]s $A_1,A_2,\ldots , A_n$, a relation over  $A_1,A_2,\ldots , A_n$ is any [[subset]] of the [[cartesian product]] $A_1\times A_2\times\ldots \times A_n$:

$$R\subseteq X_1\times X_2\times\ldots \times X_n$$

given the especial case $n=2$, we refer to it as a [[binary relation]]
