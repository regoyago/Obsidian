in mathematics, a [[binary relation]] on a [[set]] is called connected or total if it relates / compares all pairs of elements of the set

formally, a relation $R$ on a set $X$ is called strongly connected when for all $x, y \in X$
$$x \ R \ y \ \text{  or  }\  y\ R \ x$$

its a more restrictive version of a [[connected relation]]
