in mathematics a binary relation is the general concept that defines some relation between the elements of two [[set]]s

it is a generalization of the more commonly understood idea of [[mathematical function]], but with fewer restrictions

a binary relation over sets $X$ and $Y$ is a set of [[ordered pair]]s $(x,y)$ consisting of elements $x\in X, \ y\in Y$

let $R$ be a [[binary relation]] on a set $X$, which by definition is just a [[subset]] of $X\times X$
for any $x,y\in X$, the notation $x\ R \ y$ means that $(x,y)\in R$ while $\text{not } x\ R \ y$ means that  $(x,y)\notin R$

a binary relation is the most studied special case $n = 2$ in an [[n-ary relation]] over sets $X_0,X_1,\ldots X_n$

since relations are [[set]]s  they can be manipulated using set operations such as [[union]], [[intersection]] and [[inclusion]]
