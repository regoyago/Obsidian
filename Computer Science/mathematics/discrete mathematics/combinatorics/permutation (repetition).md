given $n$ elements, distributed in $r$ different [[class]]es
we define a [[permutation]] with repetition of $n$ elements with $n_1,n_2,\ldots ,n_r$ repetitions 
being $n_1$ elements of the first class, $n_2$  of the second, $n_r$ of the class $r$, such that 
$$n=n_1+n_2+\ldots +n_r$$

we define a permutation with repetition formally as:
$$PR(n;n_1,n_2,\ldots n_r)=\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\ldots n_r!}$$
we can prove this definition by using the [[rule of product]]:
from each permutation with repetition, we obtain $n_1!n_2!\ldots n_r!$ usual permutations, one for each possible order of the $n_i$ objects if we think of them as different, hence:
$$PR(n;n_1,n_2,\ldots n_r)*n_1!*n_2!*\ldots *n_r! =n!=P(n)$$
