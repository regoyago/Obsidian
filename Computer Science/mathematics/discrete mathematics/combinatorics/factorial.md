in mathematics the factorial of a non-negative [[integer number]] $n$, denoted by $n!$ is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $n$

the factorial of $n$ also equals the product of $n$ with the next smaller factorial

$$n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \ldots \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = n \times (n-1)!$$

the value of $0!$ is 1, according to the convention for an empty product
