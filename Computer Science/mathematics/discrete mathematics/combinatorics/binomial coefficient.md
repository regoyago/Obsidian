in mathematics, the binomial coefficients are the positive integers that occur as [[coefficient]]s in the [[binomial theorem]]

commonly, a binomial coefficient is indexed by a pair of integers $n \geq k \geq 0$ and is written  as $\binom{n}{k}$ it is the coefficient of the $x^k$ term in the [[polynomial expansion]] of the [[binomial power]] $(1+x)^n$ and is given by the formula

$$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$
