given $A=\{a_1,a_2,\ldots , a_n\}$, a finite [[set]] of $n$ elements 

we define a permutation  (ordinary, without repetition) of $n$ elements from $A$ as a [[bijection]] or ordered list of the different elements from the set  $A$ to $A$

the mathematical definition of permutation is given by the definition of [[factorial]]:

$$P(n)=n!=n*(n-1)*(n-2)\ldots *2*1 $$
