also known as the pigeonhole principle, simply stated, is the idea that, if $a$ items are each put into one of $b$ boxes, where $a > b$, then one of the boxes contains more than one item. 
using this one can, for example, demonstrate the existence of some element in a set with some specific properties.

this means that, given $a$ objects and $b$ boxes, and given $a > b$, there cannot exist an [[injection]]] whose [[codomain]] is smaller than its [[domain]]
