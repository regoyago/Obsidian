also know  as the addition principle, stated simply is the idea that if we have $a$ number of ways of doing something and $b$ number of ways of doing another thing, and we cannot do both at the same time, then there are $a+b$ ways to choose one of the actions

given $A_1, A_2, \ldots , A_n$ finite sets such that $\forall \ i\ne j, A_i\cap A_j = \emptyset$
then:
$$|A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \ldots \cap A_n| = |A_1|+|A_2|+\ldots + |A_n|$$

this property can be represented in a more compact way by:
$$\Big|\bigcup ^n _{i=1} \Big| = \sum ^n _{i=1} |A_i|$$
and it can be demonstrated by [[mathematical induction]]

we can think that each [[set]] $A_i$ is conformed of the different ways to do a task $i(i=1,2,\ldots ,n)$ and two task cannot be done simultaneously
the rule of the sum states that the number of ways in which one of $n$ tasks can be done is the sum of ways of doing each

as a consequence of this principle, for any [[subset]] $A\subseteq U$ it is verified that $|U|=|A|+|\bar A|$, being $\bar A$ the complementary of $A$
thus:
$$|A| = |U|-|\bar A|$$


the [[inclusion-exclusion principle]] can be thought of as a generalization of this rule
