in [[set theory]], and the branches of logic, mathematics and computer science, the [[axiom]] of extensionality says that [[set]]s having the same elements are the same set

in the formal language, the axiom reads: 
$$\forall A \forall B (\forall X (X\in A \iff X\in B) \implies A = B)$$
that is, given any sets $A$ and $B$, if, for every set $X$, $X$ is a member of $A$ if and only if $X$ is a member of $B$ then $A$ is equal to $B$
