in [[set theory]], the aleph numbers are a sequence of numbers used to represent the [[cardinality]] of [[infinite set]]s that can be [[well-ordered set]]s

the cardinality of the [[natural number]]s is $\aleph_0$, the next larger cardinality of a [[well-ordered set]] is $\aleph_1$, $\aleph_2$...

aleph numbers differ from the [[infinity]] commonly found n [[algebra]] and [[calculus]], in that the alephs measure the size of sets, while infinity is commonly defined either as an extreme [[limit]] or as en extreme point of the [[real number]] line
