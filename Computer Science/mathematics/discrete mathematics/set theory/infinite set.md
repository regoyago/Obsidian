in [[set theory]], an infinite set is a [[set]] that is not finite

the set of [[natural number]]s (whose existence is postulated by the [[axiom of infinity]]) is infinite
it is the only set that is directly required by the [[axiom]] s to be infinite, since the existence of any other infinite set can be proved only by showing that it follows from the existence of the natural numbers

a set is infinite if and only if, for every natural number the set has a [[subset]] whose [[cardinality]] is that natural number

- if a set of sets is infinite, or contains an infinite element, then its [[union]] is infinite
- the [[power set]] of an infinite set is infinite
- any [[superset]] of an infinite set is infinite
- if an infinite set is partitioned into a finite number of [[partition]]s, then any at least one is infinite 
- the [[cartesian product]] of an infinite set and a nonempty set is infinite
- the cartesian product of an infinite number of sets, each containing at least two elements, is either empty or infinite; if the [[axiom of choice]] holds, then is infinite
- if an infinite set is a [[well-ordered set]] then it must have a nonempty non [[trivial]] subset that has no greatest element
