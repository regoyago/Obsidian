in [[order theory]], a maximal element of a [[subset]] $S$ of some [[proset]] is an element of $S$ that is not smaller that any other element in $S$

formally: 
let $(P,\leq)$ be a preordered set and let $S\subseteq P$, a maximal element of $S$ with respect to $\leq$ is an element $m\in S$ such that
if $s\in S$ satisfies $m\leq s$, then necessarily $m\leq s$

if the [[subset]] $S$ is not specified then it should be assumed that $S:= P$
if the preordered set $(P,\leq)$ also happens to be a [[poset]], then $m\in S$ is a maximal element of $S$ if and only if $S$ contains no element strictly greater than $m$: that there does not exist any element $s\in S$ such that $m\leq s$ and $m\neq s$

its dual by the [[duality principle]] is the [[minimal]]
