in [[set theory]], the empty set is the unique [[set]] having no elements, that is, whose [[cardinality]] is 0

some of the most common notations for the empty set include $\{\}$, $\emptyset$, or $\varnothing$

in standard [[set theory]], by the [[principle of extensionality]], two sets are equal if they have the same elements, as a result there can only be one set with no elements, hence the usage of "the empty set" instead of the "an empty set"

for any set $A$:
- the empty set is a [[subset]] of $A$: 
$\forall A : \emptyset \subseteq A$
- the [[union]] of $A$ with the empty set is the empty set:  
$\forall A:A\cup \emptyset = A$
- the [[intersection]] of $A$ with the empty set is the empty set:
$\forall A:A\cap \emptyset = \emptyset$
- the [[cartesian product]] of $A$ with the empty set is the empty set:
$\forall A:A\times \emptyset = \emptyset$

the empty set has the following properties:
- its only subset is the empty set itself:
$\forall A:A \subseteq \emptyset \implies A = \emptyset$
- the [[power set]] of the empty set is the set containing only the empty set:
$2^{\emptyset}=\{\emptyset\}$
- the number of elements of the empty set (its [[cardinality]]) is zero:
$|\emptyset| = 0$
