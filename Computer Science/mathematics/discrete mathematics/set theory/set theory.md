set theory is the branch of [[mathematical logic]] that studies [[set]]s , which can be informally described as collections of objects

although objects of any kind can be collected into a set, set theory, as a branch of mathematics, is mostly concerned with those that are relevant to mathematics as a whole

set theory is commonly employed as a foundational system for the whole of mathematics
besides its foundational role, set theory also provides the framework to develop a mathematical theory of [[infinity]], and has various applications in computer science
