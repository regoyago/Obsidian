in mathematics, function composition is an operation that takes to [[mathematical function]]s $f$ and $g$ and produces a function $h$ such that $h(x) = g(f()x)$

in this operation the function $g$ is applied to the result of applying $f$ to $x$

the resulting composite function is denoted as $g\circ f: X\rightarrow Z$, defined by $(g\circ f)(x) = g(f(x))$ for all $x \in X$

the composition of functions is a special case of [[relation composition]], thus inheriting most of its properties
