in mathematics a surjective function or surjection is a [[mathematical function]] $f$ that maps an element $y$ to every element $y$, that is, for every $y$, there is an $x$ such that $f(x)=y$

that is to say, every element of the function's [[codomain]] is the [[image]] of at least one element of its [[domain]]

if $f:X\rightarrow Y$, then $f$ is said to be surjective if
$$\forall y \in Y, \exists x \in X\  | \ f(x) = y$$
