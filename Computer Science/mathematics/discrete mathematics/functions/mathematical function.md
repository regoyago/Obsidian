given two non-empty [[set]]s $A$ and $B$, we define an application $f$ form $A$ to $B$ as a rule that associates, to each element of $A$, a single element of $B$, 
this is named image, by $f$, of $a$ and is denoted as $f(a)$

the set $A$ is named the initial set and $B$ the final set
the relationship between $A$ and $B$ is generally represented as 

$$f:A\rightarrow B$$
$$a\leadsto f(a)=b$$

functions are also called maps or mappings 

the [[domain]] and [[codomain]] are not always explicitly given when a function is defined 
this occurs in [[mathematical analysis]], where a function from $X$ to $Y$ often refers to a function that may have a proper subset of $X$ as domain
