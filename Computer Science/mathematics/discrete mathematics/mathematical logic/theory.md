in [[mathematical logic]] a theory is a set of [[closed formula]] in a [[formal system]] 

in most scenarios , a deductive system is first understood from context, after which an element $Ï• \in T$ of a theory $T$ is then called a [[theorem]] of the theory

in many deductive systems, there is usually a [[subset]] $\sum \subset T$ that is called the set of [[axiom]]s of the theory $T$

by definition every axiom is automatically a theorem
a first order theory is a set of [[first-order logic]] sentences (theorems) obtained by the [[inference rule]]
