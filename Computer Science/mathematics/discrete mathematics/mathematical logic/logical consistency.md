a [[set]] of [[statement]] {$P_1,P_2,\ldots,P_n$} is said to be consistent if the conjunction of all its statements $P_1\wedge P_2 \wedge \ldots\wedge P_n$, admits at least a model.

otherwise, if  $P_1\wedge P_2 \wedge \ldots\wedge P_n$ is a contradiction, the set of statements {$P_1,P_2,\ldots,P_n$} is said to be inconsistent.
