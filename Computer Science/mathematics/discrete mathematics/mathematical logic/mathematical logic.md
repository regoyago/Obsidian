mathematical logic is the study of formal logic within mathematics
major subareas include model theory, [[proof theory]], [[set theory]] and recursion theory

research in this area commonly addresses the mathematical properties of [[formal system]]s of logic such as their expressive or deductive power
however, it can also include uses of logic to characterize correct mathematical reasoning or to establish foundations of mathematics

since its inception, it has contributed to, and has been motivated by, the study of foundations of mathematics
