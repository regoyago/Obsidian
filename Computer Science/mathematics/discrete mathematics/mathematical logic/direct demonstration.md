there are two main ways to make a direct demonstration of the validity of an argument:
- [[truth table]] can be used, specifically they can be used to check that the argument $H_1 \wedge H_2\wedge \ldots \wedge H_n \models C$ is a [[tautology]] ($\top$)
- a second option to make a direct demonstration is by a succession of [[statement]]s, that end with the conclusion $C$, and are considered valid for some of the following reasons:
	- it is one of the hypothesis
	- it is a known [[tautology]] ($\top$)
	- it is logically equivalent to a previous statement 
	- it is derived from some of the previous statements by inference rules
	- it can be inferred from previous statements by inference rules
	
inference rules are techniques that aid in the demonstrations of theorems.
each inference rule has its origin in a [[logical implication]]
