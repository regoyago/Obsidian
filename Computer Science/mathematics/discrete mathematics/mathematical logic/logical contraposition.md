in [[mathematical logic]], contraposition is the inference of going from a conditional statement into its logically equivalent contrapositive:
- conditional statement: $P\rightarrow Q$ in [[well-formed formula]]s the contrapositive would be $¬Q\rightarrow ¬P$
- inversion: $P\rightarrow Q$, its inversion would be $¬P\rightarrow ¬Q$
- conversion: $P\rightarrow Q$, its converse is $Q\rightarrow P$
- negation: $P\rightarrow Q$, using [[logical negation]]: $¬(P \rightarrow Q)$
