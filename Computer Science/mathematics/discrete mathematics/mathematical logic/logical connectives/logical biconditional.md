in [[mathematical logic]], the logical biconditional, normally expressed as $\leftrightarrow$, read as "if and only if" is a binary [[logical connective]]

$A \leftrightarrow B$ is true unless $A$  and $B$ have different truth values

the logical biconditional can be read as:
 - "$p$, if, and only if $q$"
 - "at least, $p$ or $q$"

its [[truth table]] is as follows:

$P$|$Q$ | $P \leftrightarrow Q$ 
---|----|---
true |true| true
false | true| false
true | false | false
false | false | true
