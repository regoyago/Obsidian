in [[mathematical logic]], the logical conjunction, normally expressed as $\wedge$, read as "and" is the [[logical connective]]

$A \wedge B$ is true if and only if $A$ and $B$ are both true

the operand of a conjunction is a conjunct
the logical conjunction can be read as:
 - "$p$ and $q$"
 - "$p$, however, $q$"
 - "$p$, even though $q$"
 - "$p$, but $q$"
 - "$p$,$q$"

beyond logic, the term "conjunction" also refers to similar concepts:
- in [[set theory]], [[intersection]]
- in [[first-order logic]], [[universal quantification]]

its [[truth table]] is as follows:

$P$|$Q$ | $P \wedge Q$ 
---|----|---
true |true| true
false | true| false
true | false | false
false | false | false
