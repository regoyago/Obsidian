in mathematics, an open formula is a [[formula]] that contains a least one  [[free variable]]

an open formula does not have a [[truth value]] assigned to it, in contrast to a [[closed formula]] which constitutes a  [[proposition]] and thus can have a truth value

an open formula can be transformed into a [[closed formula]] by applying quantifiers or specifying the [[domain of discourse]] of individuals for each free variable
this transformation is called capture of the free variables
