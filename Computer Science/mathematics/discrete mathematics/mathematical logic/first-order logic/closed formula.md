in [[mathematical logic]] a sentence or closed formula of a [[first-order logic]] is a [[boolean]] [[well-formed formula]] with no  [[free variable]]s

a sentence can be viewed as expressing a [[proposition]], something that must be true or false

the restriction of having no free variables is needed to make sure that sentences can ave concrete, fixed [[truth value]]s

sentences without any [[logical connective]]s or  [[quantifier]]s in them are known as [[atomic sentence]]s; by analogy to [[atomic formula]] sentences are then built up out of atomic formulas by applying connectives and quantifiers

a [[set]] of sentences is called a [[theory]], thus, individual sentences may be called [[theorem]]s
