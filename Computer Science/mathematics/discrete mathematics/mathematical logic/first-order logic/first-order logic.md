first-order logic, also known as predicate logic is a collection of [[formal system]]s sued in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics and computer science

while [[propositional logic]] deals with simple declarative propositions, first-order logic additionally covers [[predicate]]s and [[quantifier]]


the theory about a topic is usually a first-order logic together with a specified domain of discourse, finitely many functions from that domain to itself, finitely many [[predicate]]s defined on that domain, and a set of [[axiom]]s believed to hold about them 

the adjective first-order distinguishes first-order logic form [[higher-order logic]], in which there are predicates having predicates or functions as arguments, or in which predicate quantifiers or function quantifiers
