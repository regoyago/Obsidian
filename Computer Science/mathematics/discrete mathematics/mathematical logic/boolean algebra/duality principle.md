in [[boolean algebra]] the duality principle states as follows: 
if $\{X,R\}$ is a [[poset]], then $\{X,R(inverse)\}$ is also a poset

that is, if we were to rename the values $1,0$ to $0,1$ , the [[boolean algebra]] is bound to hold, just inverting the [[truth value]] of the [[boolean operator]]s, such that [[boolean sum]] would behave as [[boolean product]] and vice-versa
if we were to also change the names, there would be no trace of this change

when values and operations can be paired up in a way that leaves everything important unchanged when switched, we call the members of each pair dual to each other[^1]


[^1]: [[boolean complement]] is an special case, since it is considered to be self-dual, it is not needed to change
