in [[mathematical logic]] an atomic formula is a [[well-formed formula]] with no deeper [[proposition]]al structure, that is, that it does not contain any [[logical connective]]s

atoms are thus, the simplest [[well-formed formula]]s

for [[first-order logic]], atomic formulas are the [[predicate]] symbols together with their arguments
