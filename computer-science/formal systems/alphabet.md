in formal language theory, an alphabet is a non-empty [[set]] of symbols

the [[cardinality]] of an alphabet may vary on where it is used and vary form finite, countable or even uncountable

it is often necessary for practical purposes to restrict the symbols in a alphabet so that they are unambiguous when interpreted
