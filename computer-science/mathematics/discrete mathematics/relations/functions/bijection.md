an [[mathematical function]] $f:=A\rightarrow B$ is said to be bijective if it meets the requirements of being a [[surjection]] and a [[injection]] at the same time:

$$\forall a_1, a_2 \in A [a_1\neq a_2 \rightarrow f(a_1)\neq f(a_2)]$$
and
$$\forall b \in B \exists a \in A [b=f(a)]$$

that is to say , that for any element $b$ in $B$, there exist a single [[inverse image]]

a bijection from the set $X$ to the set $Y$ has an [[computer-science/mathematics/discrete mathematics/relations/functions/inverse function]] form $Y$ to $X$

a bijection from a set to itself is called a [[permutation]]
