in mathematics, a choice function is a [[mathematical function]] $f$ defined on some collection $X$ of nonempty [[set]]s and assigns some element of each set $S$ in that collection to $S$ by $f(S)$

in other words, $f$ is a choice function for $X$ if and only if it belongs to the direct product of $X$
