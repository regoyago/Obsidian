given two non-empty [[set]]s $A$ and $B$, we define an application $f$ from $A$ to $B$ as a rule that associates, to each element of $A$, a single element of $B$, 
this is named image, by $f$, of $a$ and is denoted as $f(a)$

the set $A$ is named the initial set and $B$ the final set
the relationship between $A$ and $B$ is generally represented as 

$$f:A\rightarrow B$$
$$a\leadsto f(a)=b$$

functions are also called maps or mappings 
 
the [[domain]] and [[codomain]] are not always explicitly given when a function is defined 
this occurs in [[mathematical analysis]], where a function from $X$ to $Y$ often refers to a function that may have a proper subset of $X$ as domain

in its relational approach a function $f:X\rightarrow T$ is a [[binary relation]] between $X$ and $Y$ that associates to each element of $X$ exactly one element of $Y$
that is, $f$ is defined by a set $G$ of [[ordered pair]]s $(x,y)$ with $x\in X$ and $y\in Y$ such that every element of $X$ is the first component of exactly one ordered pair in $G$
in other words, for every $x$ in $X$ there is exactly one  element $y$ such that the ordered pair $(x,y)$ belongs to the set of pairs defining the function $f$

the set $G$ is called the [[function graph]] of $f$
