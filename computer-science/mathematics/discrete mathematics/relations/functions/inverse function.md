in mathematics the inverse function of a given function is a [[mathematical function]] that undoes $f$

it exists, if and only if $f$ is a [[bijection]] and is typically denoted by $f^{-1}$

for a function $f : X\rightarrow Y$, its inverse $f^{-1} : Y\rightarrow X$ admits an explicit description: it sends each element $y \in Y$ to the unique element $x\in X$ such that $f(x)=y$
