in mathematics, a [[binary relation]] $R$ on a set $X$ is said to be transitive if, for all elements $a,b,c \in X$, whenever $R$ relates $a$ to $b$ an $b$ to $c$, then also relates $a$ to $c$

each [[partial order]] as well as each [[equivalence relation]] needs to be transitive

formally:
a [[homogeneous binary relation]] $R$ on the set $X$ is a transitive realtion if, $\forall a,b,c\in X$, 
$$a \ R \ b  \ \wedge b \ R \ c \implies \ a\ R \ c$$
