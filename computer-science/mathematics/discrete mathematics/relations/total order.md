in mathematics, a total order or linear order is a [[partial order]] in which any two elements are comparable

that is, a total order is a [[binary relation]] $\leq$ on some [[set]] $X$ which satisfies, for all $a,b$ and $c$ in $X$:
- $a\leq a$ ([[reflexive relation]])
- if $a\leq b$ and $b \leq c$ then $a \leq c$ ([[transitive relation]])
- if $a\leq b$ and $b \leq a$ then $a = b$ ([[antisymmetric relation]])
- $a\leq b$ or $b\leq a$ ([[strongly connected relation]])

the set equipped with a total order is a [[well-ordered set]]
