in mathematics a [[binary relation]] $R$ on a [[set]] $X$ is antisymmetric if there is no pair of distinct element of $X$ each of which is related by $R$ to the other

more formally, $R$ is antisymmetric if for all $a,b\in X$
$$a\ R \ b \text{ with } a\neq b \iff b\ R \ a \ \text{must not hold}$$

or equivalently:
$$\text{if } a\ R\ b \text{ and } b\ R\ a \implies a = b$$

this definition says nothing about whether $a\ R \ b$ hold or not for any $a$
