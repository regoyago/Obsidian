in mathematics and computer science, a higher order function, is a [[mathematical function]] or [[subroutine]] that either  
- takes one or more functions as arguments  
- returns a function as a results  
  
or both  
  
all other functions are first-order functions  
in mathematics, higher order functions are also termed operators or functionals  
the differential operator ([[differentiable function]]) in calculus is a common example since it [[map]]s a function to its [[derivative]], also a function  
  
in the untyped [[lambda calculus]], all functions are higher order: in a [[typed lambda calculus]], from which most [[functional programming]] languages are derive, higher order functions that take one function as argument are values with types of the form $(r_1 \to r_2)\to r_3$
