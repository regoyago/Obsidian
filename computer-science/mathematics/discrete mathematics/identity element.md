in mathematics, an identity element of a [[binary relation]] operating on a [[set]] is an element of that set which leaves unchanged every element of the set when the operation is applied

formally:
let $(S,*)$ be a set $S$ equipped with a binary operation *
then an element $e \in S$ is called a "left identity" if $e * a = a \ \forall a\in S$ , and a "right identity" if $a * e = a \ \forall a\in S$ 
if both are true, then it is a "true identity" or just identity
