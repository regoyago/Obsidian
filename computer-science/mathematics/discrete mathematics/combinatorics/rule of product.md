also named multiplication principle,  simply stated, is the idea that if there are $a$ ways of doing something, and $b$ ways of doing another thing, then there will be $a*b$ ways of doing both actions

given $A_1, A_2, \ldots , A_n$ each a finite [[set]], then: 
$$|A_1 \times A_2 \times \ldots \times A_n| = |A_1|*|A_2|*\ldots * |A_n|$$

this property can be demonstrated by [[mathematical induction]]
it is also used in the definition of [[product of cardinal numbers]]
