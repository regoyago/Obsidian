sometimes, in order to ease the demonstration, the principle of strong or complete induction is applied, which is equivalent to the principle of [[mathematical induction]]:

being $P$ a defined property over the naturals such that:
- base case: $P(k_i)$ being, generally, $i=1$
- complete inductive step: for any natural number $k$, it is satisfied that
 {$P(1),P(2),\ldots ,P(k)$} $\models P(k+1)$
 
if both are true, then we conclude that $\forall n \ P(n)$ is a true proposition
