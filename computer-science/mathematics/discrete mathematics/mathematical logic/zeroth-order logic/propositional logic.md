in [[mathematical logic]], propositional logic, sentential logic or zeroth-order logic is the logic that deals with [[proposition]]s and relations between propositions, including the construction of arguments based on them

compound prepositions are formed by connecting propositions by [[logical connective]]s

unlike [[first-order logic]], propositional logic does not deal with non-logical objects, predicates about them or [[quantifier]]s
