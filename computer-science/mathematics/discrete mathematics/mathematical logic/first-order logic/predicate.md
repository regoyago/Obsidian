in [[mathematical logic]], a predicate is a symbol which represents a property or a [[n-ary relation]], that is, it is the formalization of the mathematical concept of statement 

a predicate is generally defined as an affirmation that expresses a property of an object or a relation between them

it can also be defined as a [[well-formed formula]] that can always e evaluated to be true or false by the values of the variables that occur in it

the truth values of a predicate will depend on the values of its variables that can take values from an specific [[set]] named domain or universe

for instance, the [[first-order logic]] [[well-formed formula]] $P(a)$, the symbol $P$ is a predicate which applies to the constant $A$
similarly in the formula $R(a,b)$ the predicate $R$ is a predicate which applies to the individual constants $a$ and $b$

in the [[semantics of logic]], predicates are usually interpreted as [[n-ary relation]]s
