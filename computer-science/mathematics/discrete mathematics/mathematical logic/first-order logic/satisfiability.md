in [[mathematical logic]] a [[well-formed formula]] is satisfiable if it is true under some assignment of values to its variables

formally, satisfiability is studied with respect to a fixed logic defining the syntax is allowed symbols such as [[first-order logic]] or [[propositional logic]]

rather than being syntactic, however satisfiability is a [[semantics of logic]] property because it relates to the meaning of the symbols

the problem of determining whether a formula in [[propositional logic]] is satisfiable is known as the [[boolean satisfiability problem]]
