in [[mathematical logic]], the material implication, normally expressed as $\rightarrow$, read as "implies" is a binary [[logical connective]]

$A \rightarrow B$ is true unless $A$ is true and $B$ false

the material implication can be read as:
 - "if $p$, (then) $q$"
 - "$p$, only if $q$"
 - "when $p$, (then) $q$"
 - "$p$, sufficient to $q$"
 - "$q$ if $p$"
 - "$q$ as long as $p$"
 - "$q$ when $p$"
 - "$q$ necessary to $p$"

beyond logic, the term "conjunction" also refers to similar concepts:
- in [[set theory]], [[complement]]

its [[truth table]] is as follows:

$P$|$Q$ | $P \rightarrow Q$ 
---|----|---
true |true| true
false | true| true
true | false | false
false | false | true
