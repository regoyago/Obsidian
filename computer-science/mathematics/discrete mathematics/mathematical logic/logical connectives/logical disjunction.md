in [[mathematical logic]], the logical disjunction, normally expressed as $\vee$, read as "or" is a binary [[logical connective]] 

$A \vee B$ is true if and only $A$ , $B$ or both are true 

the logical disjunction can be read as:
 - "$p$ or $q$ (or both)"
 - "at least $p$ or $q$"

beyond logic, the term "conjunction" also refers to similar concepts:
- in [[set theory]], [[union]]

its [[truth table]] is as follows:

$P$|$Q$ | $P \vee Q$ 
---|----|---
true |true| true
false | true| true
true | false | true
false | false | false
