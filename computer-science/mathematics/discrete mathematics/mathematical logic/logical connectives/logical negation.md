in [[mathematical logic]], the logical negation, normally expressed as $¬$, read as "not" is an unary  [[logical connective]]

$¬A$ is true if and only if $A$ is false

it can be read as:
 - "no $p$"
 - "$p$ does not happen"
 - "$p$ is not true"


in logic, it can be thought of as the [[truth function]] that maps truth to falsity and vice versa

its [[truth table]] is as follows:

$P$|$¬P$
-----|------
true |false
false | true
