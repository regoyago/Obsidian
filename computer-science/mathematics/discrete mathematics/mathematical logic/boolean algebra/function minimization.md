to minimize a [[boolean function]] is to obtain the simplest expression possible for that given function.
generally, the minimized function is not unique
an expression of a function as a sum of products will be minimal if:
- there doesn't exist an expression of the function with a lower number of sums
- any other expression with the same number of sums will have more variables inside some of those sums

for a product of sums, the same as before will be true but changing sum by product

there exists several methods in order to minimize a function, the most widely known: [[karnaugh map]]
