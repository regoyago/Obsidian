in [[set theory]], the union (denoted by $\cup$) of a collection of [[set]]s is the set of all elements in the collection

it is one of the fundamental operations through which sets can be combined and related to each other

the union of two sets $A$ and $B$ is the set of elements which are in $A$, $B$ or in both:
$A\cup B = \{x:x\in A\ or\  x\in B\}$

the binary union has its following properties [^1]

- binary union is an [[associative]] operation; that is, for any sets $A$,$B$, $C$:
$A\cup (B\cup C)\ =\ (A \cup B)\cup C$ 
thus the parenthesis may be omitted without ambiguity

- binary union is [[commutative]], so the sets can be written in any other

- the [[empty set]] is an [[identity element]] for the operation of union

- the union operation is [[idempotent]]


the most general notion is the union of an arbitrary collection of sets, sometimes called an infinitary union
if $M$ is a set or a class whose elements are sets, then $x$ is an element of the union $M$ if and only if there is at least one element $A$ of $M$ such that $x$ is an element of $A$:
$$x\in \bigcup M \iff \exists A \in M, x\in A$$

[^1]: all of these properties are analogous to those of a [[logical disjunction]]
