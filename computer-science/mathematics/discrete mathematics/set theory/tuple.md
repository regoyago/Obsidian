in mathematics, a tuple is a finite ordered list(sequence) of elements

an n-tuple is a sequence of $n$ elements, where $n$ is a non-negative [[integer number]]

there is only one 0-tuple, referred to as the empty tuple

an n-tuple is defined using [[recursion]] by the construction of an [[ordered pair]]
