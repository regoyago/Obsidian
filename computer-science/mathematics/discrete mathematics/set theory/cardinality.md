in [[set theory]], the cardinality of a [[set]] is a measure of "the number of elements" of the set

there are two approaches to cardinality, one which compares sets directly using [[bijection]]s and [[injection]]s an another which uses [[cardinal number]]s

the cardinality of a set $A$ is usually denoted as $|A|$, that is, the same notation as [[absolute value]]

when talking about [[infinite set]]s, the [[aleph number]]s are introduced
