in [[set theory]], the axiom of choice is an [[axiom]] equivalent to the [[statement]]  "a [[cartesian product]] of a collection of non-empty sets is non-empty"

informally put, the axiom of choice says that given any collection of bins, each containing at least one object, it is possible to make a selection of exactly one object from each bin even if the collection is [[infinity]]

formally, this may be expressed as follows:

$$\forall X [\emptyset \notin X  \implies \forall f : X \rightarrow \bigcup X \forall A \in X (f(A))\in A]$$

thus, the [[logical negation]] of the axiom states that there exists a collection of nonempty sets that has no [[choice function ]]
