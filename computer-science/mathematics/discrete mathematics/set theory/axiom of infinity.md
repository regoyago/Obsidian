in [[set theory]] the axiom of infinity guarantees the existence of at least one [[infinite set]], namely containing all [[natural number]]s

in the formal language, the [[axiom]] reads:
$$\exists I (\emptyset \in I \wedge \forall x \in I ((x\cup \{x\})\in I))$$
in words, there is a [[set]] $I$ such that the [[empty set]] is in $I$ and such that whenever any $x$ is a member of $I$, the set formed by taking the [[union]] of $x$ with its [[singleton]] $\{x\}$ is also a member of $I$
such a set is sometimes called an inductive set
