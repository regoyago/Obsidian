in mathematics, a partial order relation is a [[homogeneous binary relation]] that is [[transitive relation]] and [[antisymmetric relation]]

there are two common sub-definitions for a partial order relation, for reflexive and irreflexive partial order relations, also called "non-strict" and "strict" respectively

the term partial order typically refers to anon-strict partial order relation

- a reflexive partial order is a homogeneous binary relation $\leq$ on a set $P$ that is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive, that is,for all $a,b,c \in P$, it must satisfy:
	- $a\leq a$ ([[reflexive relation]])
	- if $a\leq b$ and $b \leq a$ then $a = b$ ([[antisymmetric relation]])
	- if $a\leq b$ and $b\leq c$ then $a\leq c$ ([[transitive relation]])

-  an irreflexive partial order is a homogeneous relation $<$ on a set $P$ that is irreflexive, transitive and asymmetric, that is, for all $a,b,c \in P$, it must satisfy:
	-  $a\not< a$ ([[irreflexive relation]])
	-  if $a < b$ and $b < a$ then $a = b$ ([[antisymmetric relation]])
	- if $a < b$ and $b < c$ then $a < c$ ([[transitive relation]])
