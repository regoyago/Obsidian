in mathematics, specially in [[order theory]], a preorder or quasiorder is a [[binary relation]] that is both a [[reflexive relation]] and a [[transitive relation]]

preorders are more general than [[equivalence relation]]s and non strict [[partial order]]s

the name preorder comes from the idea that preorders are almost partial orders (they lack the need to be [[antisymmetric relation]]) 

for every preorder, there corresponds a [[directed graph]], with elements of the set corresponding to vertices, and the order relation between pairs  of elements corresponding to the directed edges between vertices

formally: 
consider a [[homogeneous binary relation]] $\leq$ on some given set $P$ so that, by definition $\leq$ is some [[subset]] of $P\times P$ and the notation $a\leq b$ is used in place of $(a,b)\in \leq$
then $\leq$ is called a preorder if it is [[reflexive relation]] and [[transitive relation]]:
- $a\leq a\ \  \forall a \in P$
- if $a\leq b$ and $b\leq c$ then $a \leq c$
this preorder can also be named "non-strict" preorder to avoid confusion 

if reflexivity was to be changed in favor of reflexivity, the resulting binary relation is a strict partial
