in [[set theory]], the [[axiom]] of [[power set]] is as follows:

$$\forall x \exists y \forall z[z\in y \iff \forall w(w\in z \implies w\in x)]$$
where $y$ is the [[power set]] of $x$, $P(x)$

expressed with words:
given any [[set]] $x$ there exists a set $P(x)$ such that , given any set $z$, this set $z$ is a member of $P(x)$ if and only if every element of $z$ is also an element of $x$
