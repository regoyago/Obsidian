in [[set theory]], the cartesian product of two [[set]]s $A$ and $B$ (denoted $A \times B$) is the set of all [[ordered pair]]s $(a,b)$ where $a\in A$ and $b\in B$, that is:

$$A\times B = \{(a,b)| a\in A \text{ and } b \in B\}$$
one can similarly define the cartesian product of $n$ sets also known as n-fold cartesian product, which can be represented by an n-dimensional array, where each element is an n-[[tuple]]
