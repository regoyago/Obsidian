in mathematics, more specifically in [[graph theory]], a graph is a structure amounting to a [[set]] of objects in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense "related"[^1]

formally:
a graph is an [[ordered pair]] $G = (V,E)$ where $V$ is the set whose elements are called [[vertex]]s and $E$ that set of paired vertices ([[edge]]s)

the objects correspond to mathematical abstractions called [[vertex]]s
and each of the related pairs of vertices is called a [[edge]]

an [[empty graph]] is that graph that has the [[empty set]]  as its set of vertices

the vertex $x$ and $y$ are defined as the endpoint the edge $\{x,y\}$ 
all the edges of a graph define a [[symmetric relation]] on the vertices, called the adjacency relation
a graph may be fully specified by its [[adjacency matrix]] $A$

typically, a graph is depicted in diagrammatic form as a set of dots joined by lines

the edges may be directed or undirected, differentiating between undirected (or simply graphs) and [[directed graph]]s

moreover, two different measures have to be made when talking about graphs: [[graph order]] and [[graph size]]
