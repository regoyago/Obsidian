in [[graph theory]], a hamiltonian trail is a trail in a finite graph that visits every [[vertex]] exactly once (allowing for revisiting edges)

similarly, a hamiltonian circuit or cycle s an eulerian trail that starts and ends on the same [[vertex]]

determining whether such paths and cycles exists in graphs is the [[hamiltonian path problem]]

it is known that all hamiltonian paths are [[biconnected]], but not all biconnected graphs are hamiltonian

the [[eulerian path]]'s  [[line graph]] $L(G)$  corresponds to a hamiltonian cycle so the line graph of every eulerian graph is hamiltonian

a [[tournament]] with more than two vertices is hamiltonian if and only if it presents a [[strongly connected relation]]

the number of different hamiltonian cycles in a complete undirected graph of $n$ vertices is $\frac{(n-1)!}{2}$
and in complete directed graphs $(n-1)!$
