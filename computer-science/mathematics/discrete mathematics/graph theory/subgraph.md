in [[graph theory]], a subgraph of a [[graph]] $G$ is another graph formed from a [[subset]] of the [[vertex]] set , but may also include additional vertices

a spanning subgraph is one that includes all vertices of the graph

an induced subgraph is one that includes all the edges whose endpoints belong to the vertex subset
