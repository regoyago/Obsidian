in [[graph theory]], the line graph of an indirect graph $G$ is another graph $L(G)$ that represents the adjacencies between [[edge]]s of $G$

$L(G)$ is constructed the following way: for each edge in $G$ make a [[vertex]] in $L(G)$, for every two edges in $G$ that have a vertex in common, make an edge between their corresponding vertices in $L(G)$
