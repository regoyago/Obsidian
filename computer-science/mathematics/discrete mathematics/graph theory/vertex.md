in [[graph theory]], a vertex is the fundamental unit of which graphs are formed

from the viewpoint of graph theory, vertices are treated as featureless and indivisible objects, although they may have additional structure depending on the application from which the graph arises

the degree of a vertex, denoted by $\delta (v)$ in a [[graph]] is the number of edges incident to it
- an isolated vertex is a vertex with $0$ as degree
- a leaf vertex is a vertex with degree $1$
- an universal vertex is that vertex that is adjacent to every other vertex
