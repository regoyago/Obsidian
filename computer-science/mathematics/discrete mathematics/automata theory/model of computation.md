in computer science, more specifically in [[computational complexity theory]], a model of computation is a model which describes how an output of a [[mathematical function]] is computed given an input

the [[computational complexity]] of an [[algorithm]] can be measured given a model of computation

models of computation can be classified into three categories: sequential models, functional models and concurrent models
- sequential models
	- [[finite state machine]]
	- [[post-turing machine]] and [[tag machine]]
	- [[pushdown automaton]]
	- [[turing machine]]
- functional models
	- [[lambda calculus]]
	- [[general recursive function]]
	- [[combinatory logic]]
	- [[abstract rewriting system]]
- concurrent models
	- [[actor model]]
	- [[cellular automaton]]
	- [[interaction net]]
	- [[kahn process network]]
	- [[logic gate]]  and [[digital circuit]]
	- [[petri net]]
	- [[synchronous data flow]]
