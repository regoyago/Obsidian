a finite state machine or finite state machine is a mathematical [[model of computation]]

it is an [[abstract machine]] that can be in exactly one of a finite number of [[machine state]]s at any given time

it can change from one state to another in response to some input that trigger each transition

there are two different types:
- [[deterministic finite state machine]]
- [[non-deterministic finite state machine]]

the finite state machine has less computational power than some other models
