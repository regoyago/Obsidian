in mathematics, an inverse element of a [[binary relation]] operating on a [[set]] is an element of that set which undoes every element of the set when the operation is applied

if $x*y = e$, where $e$ is an identity element, one says that $x$ is a left inverse of $y$, and $x$ is a right inverse of $y$
left and right inverses do not always exist, even when the operation is total and [[associative]]
an element can have several left and right inverses, even when the operation is total and associative 

generally, a [[mathematical function]] has a left inverse for [[function composition]] if and only id it is an [[injection]] and right inverse if and only if it is a [[surjection]] 

in the common case where the operation is associative, the left and right inverse of an element are equal and unique, that is
if $l$ and $r$ are respectively a left and a right inverse of $x$, then
$$l=l*(x*r)=(l*x)*r = r$$
and we can say that the given element is invertible[^1]

- if the operation is denoted as addition, the inverse of an element $x$ is denoted as $-x$
- otherwise, the inverse of $x$ is generally denoted as $x^{-1}$, or in the case of [[commutative]] multiplication $\frac{1}{x}$

if $x$ and $y$ are invertible, and $x*y$ is defined, then $x*y$ is invertible, and its inverse is $y^{-1}x^{-1}$

[^1]: note that in this case, the [[binary relation]] has the properties of both [[injection]] and [[surjection]], thus being a [[bijection]]
