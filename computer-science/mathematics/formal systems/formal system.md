a formal system is an abstract structure used for inferring [[theorem]]s form [[axiom]] according to a set of rules

these rules which are used for carrying out the inference of theorems from axioms, are the logical calculus of the formal system

each formal system uses primitive symbols (which form an alphabet) to finitely construct a formal language from a set of axioms though the inferential rules of formation

this systems consists of valid formulas built up through finite combinations of the primitive symbols, combinations that are formed from the axioms in accordance with the rules

more formally, this can be expressed as the following:
- a finite set of symbols, known as the [[alphabet]], which concatenate formulas, so that a formula is just a finite string of symbols taken from the alphabet
- a  grammar consisting of rules to form formulas from simpler formulas, a formula is said to be a  [[well-formed formula]] if it can be formed using the rules of the formal grammar
- a set of axioms or [[axiom schemata]], consisting of well formed formulas
- a set of [[inference rule]], a well formed formula that can be inferred from the axioms is known as a theorem of the formal system
