in mathematics, a theorem is a statement that has been proved or can be proved
the proof of a theorem is a logical argument that uses the [[inference rule]] of a deductive system to establish the theorem is a [[logical implication]] of the [[axiom]]s and previously proved theorems

in [[mathematical logic]] the concepts of theorems and proofs have been formalized in order to allow mathematical reasoning about them

in this context, statements become [[well-formed formula]]s of some [[formal system]]
a theory consist of some basis statements called axioms, and some deducing rules
this formalization led to [[proof theory]] which allows proving general theorems about theorems and profs
