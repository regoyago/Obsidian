in calculus, a one-sided limit is either one of the two  [[limit]]s of a [[mathematical function]] $f$ of a [[real number]] variable $x$ as $x$ approaches a specified point either from the right or the left

the limit as $x$ decreases in value approaching the specified point $c$ (from the right or from above) can be denoted as 

$$\lim_{x\to a^+}f(x) = \lim_{x\downarrow a} f(x) $$

rigorously defined as 
$$\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0, \forall x \in I(0<x-a<\delta \implies |f(x)-L|<\epsilon)$$

where $I$ represents some interval in the [[domain]] of $f$


the limit as $x$ increases in value approaching the specified point $c$ (from the left or from bellow) can be denoted as 

$$\lim_{x\to a^-}f(x) = \lim_{x\uparrow a} f(x) $$

rigorously defined as 
$$\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0, \forall x \in I(0<a-x<\delta \implies |f(x)-L|<\epsilon)$$

where $I$ represents some interval in the [[domain]] of $f$


a [[mathematical function]] $f$ has a [[limit]] $L$ at $x_0$ if and only if both its left-hand and right-hand limits at $x_0$ are $L$
