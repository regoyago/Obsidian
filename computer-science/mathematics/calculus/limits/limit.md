 in mathematics, the limit is the value that a [[mathematical function]] (or sequence) approaches as the input approaches a given value  
  
in formulas, a limit of a function is usually written as:  
  
$$\lim_{x \to c}f(x)= L$$  
  
and is read as "the limit of $f$ of $x$ as $x$ approaches $c$ equals $L$"  
the fact that a function $f$ approaches a limit $L$ as $x$ approaches $c$ is sometimes denoted by a right arrow:  
$f(x)\to L$ as $x\to c$  
which reads "$f$ of $x$ tends to $L$ as $x$ tends to $c$"  
  
  
  
suppose $f$ as a [[mathematical function]] whose values are [[real number]]s, and $c$ a [[real number]]  
the definition [^1] of a limit uses $\epsilon$ to represent any small positive number so that "$f(x)$ becomes arbitrarily close to $L$", that is to say, that $f(x)$ eventually lies on the [[interval]] $(L-\epsilon , L+\epsilon)$ also written as $|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$  
  
the phrase "as $x$ approaches $c$", then indicates that we refer to values of $x$ whose distance from $c$ is less than some positive number $\delta$, that is, values of $x$ within either $(c-\delta , c)$ or $(c, c+\delta)$ which can be expressed as $0<|x-c|<\delta$, the first inequality means that the distance between $x$ and $c$ is greater than $0$ and that $x\neq c$, while the second indicates that $x$ is within the distance $\delta$ of $c$  
  
the above definition of a limit is true even if $f(c)\neq L$, indeed the function $f$ need not even be defined at $c$
