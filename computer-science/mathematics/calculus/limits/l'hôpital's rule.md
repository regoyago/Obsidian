in calculus, l'hôpital's rule provides a technique to evaluate [[limit]]s

it states that for [[mathematical function]]s $f$ and $g$ which are [[differentiable function]]s on  an open [[interval]] $I$, except possibly at a point $c\in I$, if

$$\lim_{x\to c}f(x)=\lim_{x\to c}g(x)=0 \text{ or } \pm \infty$$  and
$$g'(x)\neq 0 \ \ \ \ (\forall x \in I) (x\neq c) $$ and
$$\exists \lim_{x\to c}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$$ then

$$\lim_{x\to c}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\lim_{x\to  c} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$$

the differentiation of the numerator and the denominator often simplifies the quotient or converts it to a limit that can be evaluated directly

when the result obtained is not enough to ease the solving of the limit, if the conditions are met, this rule can be applied again

the indeterminate form $0.\infty$, $\infty -\infty$, $0^0$,  $\infty^0$ and $1^{\infty}$ can always be reduced to l'hôpital's indeterminancies
