in calculus, rolle's theorem essentially states that any [[differentiable function]] over the [[real number]]s tat attains equal values at two distinct points must have at least an [[extrema]]

let $f:[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$ a [[continuous function]] on $[a,b]$, differentiable on $(a,b)$ and such that $f(a)=f(b)$
then, there exist at least one point $x_0\in (a,b)$ such that $f'(x_0)=0$
