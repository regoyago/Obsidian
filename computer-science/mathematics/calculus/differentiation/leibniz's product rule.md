in calculus, the product rule is a formula used to find the [[derivative]]s of product or two or more [[mathematical function]]s
for two functions:

$$(u.v)'=u'.v+u.v'$$

this rule may be extended or generalized to products of three or more functions, to a rule of higher order derivatives of a product and to other contexts
 - product of more than two factors:
	- exemplifying  for three functions:
$$\frac{d(uvw)}{dx}=\frac{du}{dx}vw+u\frac{dv}{dx}w+\frac uv{dw}{dx}$$
	- for a collection of functions $f_1,\ldots f_k$ we have
	
$$\frac{d}{dx} \left[ \prod_{i=1}^k f_i(x)\right]=\sum^k_{i=1}\left( \left( \frac{d}{dx}f_i(x)\right) \prod_{j=1,j\neq i}^k f_j(x)\right) = \left( \prod^k_{i=1} f_i(x)\right)  \left(\sum_{i=1}^k \frac{f'_i(x)}{f_i(x)}\right)$$

by the [[logarithmic differentiation]] we can provide a simpler expression of the last form, as well as direct proof that does not involve any recursion

the product rule can be thought of as an specific case of the [[chain rule]]
