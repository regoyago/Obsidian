differentiability class is a classification of [[mathematical function]]s according to the properties of their [[derivative]]s, it is a measure of the highest order derivative that exists for a function

let $f$ be a [[mathematical function]] with values over the [[real number]]s, and $k$ an [[integer number]]:
the function $f$ is said to be of (differentiability) class $C^k$ if the derivatives $f',f'',\ldots ,f^{(k)}$ exist and are [[continuous function]]s

$f$ is said to be infinitely  differentiable, smooth, or of class $C^{\infty}$, if it has derivatives of all orders

$f$ is said to be of class $C^\omega$ or  analytic, if its smooth and if its [[taylor's series]] expansion around any point in its [[domain]] converges to the function in some neighborhood of the point, thus $C^\omega$ is strictly contained in $C^{\infty}$

that is to say, the class $C^0$ consists of all [[continuous function]]s, $C^1$ of all [[differentiable function]]s whose derivatives are continuous, thus,  a $C^1$ function is exactly a function whose derivative exists and is a $C^0$ function
in general, the classes $C^k$ can be recursively defined  by declaring $C^0$ to be the set of all continuous functions, and declaring $C^k$ for any positive [[integer number]] $k$ to be the set of all differentiable functions whose [[derivative]] is $C^{k-1}$
