in calculus, logarithmic differentiation or differentiation by taking logarithms is a method to differentiate [[mathematical function]]s by employing the logarithmic [[derivative]] of a function

$$(ln(f))' = \frac{f'}{f} \implies f'=f.(ln(f))'$$

the technique is often performed in cases where it is easier to differentiate the logarithm of a function rather than the function itself [^1]
it can also be useful when applied to functions raised to the power of variables or functions

logarithmic differentiation relies on the [[chain rule]] as well as properties of [[logarithmic function]]s to transform products into sums and divisions into subtractions

the principle can be implemented, at least in part, in the differentiation of almost all [[differentiable function]]s, providing that these functions are non-zero


[^1]: this usually occurs in cases where the function of interest is composed of a product of a number of parts, so that the logarithmic transformation will turn it into a sum of separate parts, which is much easier to differentiate
