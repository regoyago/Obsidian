a [[mathematical function]] of a [[real number]] $y=f(x)$ is said to be differentiable at a point $a$ of its [[domain]], if its domain contains an open interval, containing the point $x=a$ if it exists, and is real, the [[limit]]

$$\lim_{h\to 0}\left( \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \right)$$

this means that, for every positive [[real number]] $\epsilon$, there exists a positive real number $\delta$ such that, for every $h$ such that $|h|<\\delta$ and $h\neq 0$ them $f(a+h)$ is defined and 
$\left|L-\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}<\epsilon\right|$
where the vertical bars denote the absolute value

if the function is differentiable at $a$, that is, if the limit $L$ exists, then this limit is called the derivative of $f$ at $a$, and denoted as $f'(a)$

in mathematics, the derivative of a function measures the sensitivity to change of the function value with respect to a change in its argument 
derivatives are fundamental to calculus
the derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point [^1]
it is for this reason that the derivative is often described as the "instantaneous rate of change"

[^1]:a tangent line is the best linear approximation of the function at a given point
