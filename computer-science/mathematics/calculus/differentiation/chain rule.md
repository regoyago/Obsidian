in calculus, the chain rule is a formula that expresses the [[derivative]] of the [[function composition]] for two [[differentiable function]]s $f$ and $g$
more precisely, if $h=f\circ g$ is the [[mathematical function]] such that $h(x)=f(g(x))$ for every $x$, then the chain rule is:
$$h'(x)=f'(g(x))g'(x)$$
or, equivalently
$$h'=(f\circ g)' = (f'\circ g)g'$$
