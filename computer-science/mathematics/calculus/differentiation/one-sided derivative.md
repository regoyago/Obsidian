in calculus, a one-sided derivative is either one of the two  [[derivative at a point]] of a [[mathematical function]] $f$ of a [[real number]] variable $x$ as $x$ approaches a specified point either from the right or the left

since the definition of [[derivative at a point]] is stated as a [[limit]], the [[one-sided derivative]]s, will just be the [[one-sided limit]]s of the limit of the definition of the derivative:

left side derivative:
$$\lim_{h\to 0^-}\left( \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \right)$$

right side derivative:
$$\lim_{h\to 0^+}\left( \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \right)$$
