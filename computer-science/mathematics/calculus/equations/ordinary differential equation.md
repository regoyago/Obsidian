in mathematics, an ordinary differential equation (ODE)  is a [[differential equation]] containing one or more [[mathematical function]] of one independent value and the [[derivative]] of those functions
the name exists in contrast to [[partial differential equation]]s , which may be with respect to more than one independent value

let $y$ be a dependent variable, and $x$ n independent variable, and $y=f(x)$ an unknown function of $x$ [^1]

- given $F$ a function of $x$, y and derivatives of $y$, then an equation of the form
$$F(x,y',\ldots,y^{(n-1)}) = y^{(n)}$$
	is called an explicit ordinary differential equation of order $n$

	 more generally an implicit ordinary differential equation of order $n$ takes the form:$$F(x,y,y',\ldots, y^{(n)})= 0$$
- a differential equation that does not depend on $x$ is called autonomous differential equation
- a differential equation is said to be linear if $F$ can be written as a [[linear combination]] of the derivatives of $y$$$y^{(n)}= \sum^{n-1}_{i=0} a_i(x)y^{(i)}+r(x)$$ where $a_i(x)$ and $r(x)$ are [[continuous function]]s of $x$
- if $r(x)=0$ and consequently one solution is the trivial solution, the solution of a [[linear homogeneous equation]] is a complementary function, denoted by $y_c$


[^1]: there exists several notations to express this [[lagrange's notation]], [[leibniz's notation]], [[newton's notation]]...
