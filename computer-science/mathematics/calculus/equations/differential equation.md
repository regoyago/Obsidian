in mathematics, a differential equation is an [[equation]] that relates one or more unknown [[mathematical function]]s and their [[derivative]]s

mainly the study of differential equations consists of the study of their solution 

differential equations can be divided into several types 
apart from describing the properties of the equation itself, these classes of differential equations can help inform the choice of approach to the solution

- [[ordinary differential equation]]s
- [[partial differential equation]]s
- [[non-linear differential equation]]s
- equation order: differential equations are described by their order, determined by the term with the highest derivative
