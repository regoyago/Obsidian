in calculus, integration by parts or partial integration is a process that finds the [[integral]] of a product of [[mathematical function]]s in terms of the integral of the product of their [[derivative]] and [[indefinite integral - antiderivative]]

it is frequently used to transform the antiderivative of a product of functions into an antiderivative for which a solution can more easily be found

the rule can be thought of as the integral version of the [[leibniz's product rule]]

the integration by parts formula states 

$$\int_a^bu(x)v'(x)dx=\left[ u(x)v(x)\right]^b_a-\int_a^bu'(x)v(x)dx=$$

$$=u(b)v(b)-u(a)v(a)-\int_a^bu'(x)v(x)dx$$

or letting $u=u(x)$ and $du=u'(x)dx$ while $v=v(x)$ and $dv=v'(x)dx$, the formula can be written more compactly:

$$\int u\ dv= uv-\int v\ du$$
