an [[improper integral]] converges if the limit defining it exists, thus, for example, one says that the improper integral

$$\lim_{t\to \infty} \int_a^t f(x)dx$$

exists and is equal to $L$ if the integrals under the [[limit]] for all sufficiently large $t$, and the value of the limit is equal to $L$

it is also possible for an improper integral to diverge to infinity
in that case, one may assign the value $\infty$ or $-\infty$ to the [[integral]] for instance:

$$\lim_{b\to\infty}\int_1^b \frac{dx}{x}=\intfy$$

however, other improper integrals may simply diverge in no particular direction [^1], this is called divergence by oscillation 

[^1]: such as $\lim_{b\to \infty} \int_1^{b} xsin(x)dx$
