- a bounded [[mathematical function]] on a compact [[interval]] $[a,b]$ is riemann integrable if and only if it is a [[continuous function]] almost everywhere:  (the set of its points of discontinuity has to be a [[null set]])
therefore, every [[differentiable function]] is integrable
- every [[monotonic function]] and bounded on $[a,b]$ is integrable on $a,b$
- every bounded [[mathematical function]] on $[a,b]$, with a finite number of discontinuity points on that interval, is integrable on $[a,b]$
- let $f$ be a integrable function on $[a,b]$ in the riemann sense, and such that:
$$m\leq f(x)\leq M, \ \ \ \ \ \ \forall x\in [a,b]$$
if $g$ is continuous on $[m,M]$, then the [[function composition]] $g\circ f$ is also integrable on $[a,b]$
