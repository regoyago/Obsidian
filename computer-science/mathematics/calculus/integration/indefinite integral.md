in calculus, an antiderivative, inverse derivative, primitive function or indefinite integral of a [[mathematical function]] $f$  is a [[differentiable function]] $F$ whose [[derivative]] is equal to the original function $f$

$$F'=f$$

antiderivatives are related to  definite[[integral]]s through the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]: the definite integral of a function over an [[interval]] is equal to the difference between the values of an antiderivative evaluated at the endpoints of the interval

every [[continuous function]] $f$ has an antiderivative $F$ is given by the [[integral]] of $f$ with variable upper boundary:
$$F(x)=\int_0^xf(t)dt$$
varying the lower boundary produces other antiderivatives (but not necessarily all possible antiderivatives)
