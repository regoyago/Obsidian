also known as the second part of the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]]:

let $f$ be a [[continuous function]] over the [[real number]]s defined over a closed [[interval]] $[a,b]$, let $F$ be an [[indefinite integral - antiderivative]] of $f$ in  $(a,b)$
$F'(x)=f(x)$
if $f$ is , by [[riemann integrable function]] on $[a,b]$, then:

$$\int_a^bf(x)dx = F(b)-F(a)$$
