in mathematics, a plane is a flat two dimensional [[surface]] that extends indefinitely, it is the two dimensional analogue of a [[point]], a [[line]] and three dimensional [[space]]
planes can arise as [[vector subspace]]s of some higher-dimensional spaces

in a [[euclidean space]] of any number of dimensions, a plane is uniquely determined by any of the following:
- three non-[[collinear]] points
- a line and a point not on that line
- two distinct but intersecting lines
- two distinct but parallel lines
