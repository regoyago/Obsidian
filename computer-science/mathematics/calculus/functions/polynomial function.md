the polynomial function is a function that follows:  
  
$$f(x)=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\ldots + a_1x+a_0$$  
  
with $a_0,a_1,\ldots ,a_n \in \mathbb{R}$ and $a_n\neq 0$  
  
- the degree of the polynomial is $n$  
- the leading coefficient is $a_n$  
  
the [[domain]] of the function is $\mathbb{R}$
