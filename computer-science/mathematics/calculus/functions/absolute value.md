the absolute value, or modulus of a [[real number]] $x$, denoted by $|x|$, is the [[mathematical function]] that gives the non-negative value of $x$ without regard to its sign  
namely $|x|=x$ if $x$ is positive and $|x|=-x$ if $x$ is negative and $|0|=0$  
  
the absolute value can be thought as the distance from the given $x$ to $0$  
and is closely related to the notion of [[magnitude]], [[distance]] and [[norm]]  
  
the absolute value is also defined for the [[complex number]]s, [[ordered ring]]s, [[field]]s and [[vector space]]s
