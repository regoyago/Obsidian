in analytic geometry, an asymptote of a curve is a line such that the distance between the curve and the line approaches zero as one or both of the $x$ or $y$ coordinates tends to infinity [^1]

in projective geometry, an asymptote of a curve is a line which is tangent to the curve at a point at infinity

there are three kinds of asymptotes:
- horizontal
horizontal asymptotes are horizontal lines that the graph of the [[mathematical function]] approaches as $x\to \pm \infty$
the horizontal line $y=c$ is a horizontal asymptote of the function $y=f(x)$ if
	- $\lim_{x\to +\infty}f(x) = c$ or
	- $\lim_{x\to -\infty}f(x) = c$ 
functions may lack horizontal asymptotes on either or both sides, or may have one that is the same in both directions


- vertical
the line $x=a$ is a vertical asymptote of the graph of the function $y=f(x)$ if at least one of the following :
	- $\lim_{x\to a^-}f(x)=\pm \infty$
	- $\lim_{x\to a^-}f(x)=\pm \infty$
	the function $f(x)$ may or may not be defined at $a$, and its precise value at the point $x=a$ does not affect the asymptote
	it must be noted that in order for an vertical asymptote to be able to exist, the function $f(x)$ must not be a [[continuous function]] at all points
	moreover, if a function gas a vertical asymptote, then it is not necessarily true that the derivative of the function has a vertical asymptote at the same place
	
- oblique
when a linear asymptote is not parallel to any of the axis, it is called a oblique or slant asymptote  a function $f(x)$ is asymptotic to the straight line $y=mx+n(m\neq 0)$[^2] if:
	-  $\lim_{x\to +\infty}[f(x)-(mx+n)]$ or
	-  $\lim_{x\to -\infty}[f(x)-(mx+n)]$ 



[^1]: it is because of this definition that the concepts of asymptote  and [[limit]] are closely related
[^2]: it must be noted that the definition of oblique asymptote can be interpreted as a generalization of all asymptotes: if $m=0$ we are talking about a horizontal asymptote, if $m=\pm \infty$, a vertical asymptote it is
