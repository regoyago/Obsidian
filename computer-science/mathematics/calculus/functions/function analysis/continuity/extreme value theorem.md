in calculus, the extremme value theorem states that a [[continuous function]] of [[real number]]s $f$ bounded on the [[interval]] $[a,b]$, must attain the [[exteme value]] (maximum and minimum), each at least once

that is, there exist numbers $c$ and $d$ in $[a,b]$ such that

$$f(c)\geq f(x) \geq f(d) \forall x\in [a,b]$$

this theorem can be proven by finding a sequence ( [[patially ordered set (poset)]]) so that its image converges to the supremum of $f$
