when a given [[mathematical function]] $f$ is not a [[continuous function]] at a given point $c$, that function is said to have a discontinuity at the point $c$

- removable discontinuity:[^1]
we define the following:
	- $\exists L^- = \lim_{x\to c^-}f(x)$
	- $\exists L^+ = \lim_{x\to c^+}f(x)$
	- $L^-=L^+=L$
	- $L \neq f(c)$
	at $c$, both [[one-sided limit]]s exist, are finite and equal, thus the [[limit]] exists $L=L^-=L^+$, but, since it is not equal to the specific value of $f(c)$, there is an discontinuity, specifically, a removable discontinuity 
	
- jump discontinuity
we define the following:
	- $\exists L^- = \lim_{x\to c^-}f(x)$
	- $\exists L^+ = \lim_{x\to c^+}f(x)$
	- $L^-\neq L^+$
	that is to say, that both the [[one-sided limit]]s exist, but they are not equal, thus $\nexists \ \lim_{x\to c}$

- essential discontinuity
we define an essential discontinuity as those in which any of the [[one-sided limit]] does not exist



[^1]: the term removable discontinuity is sometimes an abuse of terminology for cases in which the limits in both directions exist and are equal, whole the function is not a [[defined function]] at the given point $c$. this is abusive because the concept of [[continuous function]] is only defined for points in the funcion's domain. such a point not in the domain is properly names a removable singularity
