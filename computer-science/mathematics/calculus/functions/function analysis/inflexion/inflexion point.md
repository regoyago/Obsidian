in differential calculus, an inflexion or flex point on a [[smooth plane curve]] is a point at which the curvature changes sign
in particular in the case of the graph of a function, it is a point where the function changes from concave to convex

let $f:[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$ a [[continuous function]]
we say that $f$ is convex on $[a,b]$ if:

$$f(x)\leq \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}(x-a)+f(a) \ \ \ \ \ \forall x\in [a,b]$$

we say that $f$ is convex on $[a,b]$ if $-(f)$ is convex on $[a,b]$

let $f:[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$ a [[continuous function]] on $[a,b]$ and a [[differentiable function]] on $(a,b)$, then $f$ is convex on $[a,b]$ if and only if $f'$ is increasing on $(a,b)$, this is equivalent to $f''\geq 0$ if $f$ has a second order [[derivative]]

analogously, $f$ is concave on $[a,b]$ if and only if $f'$ is decreasing on $(a,b)$, this is equivalent to $f''\leq 0$ if $f$ has a second order [[derivative]]
