a monotonic [[mathematical function]] is a function between ordered [[set]]s that preserves or reverses the given order [^1]

let a $f: A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a real function of one variable 
let $B\subset A$
- $f$ is increasing in $B$ if:
$$x_1<x_2 \implies f(x_1)\leq f(x_2), \forall x_1,x_2 \in B$$
- $f$ is strictly increasing in $B$ if:
$$x_1<x_2 \implies f(x_1)< f(x_2), \forall x_1,x_2 \in B$$
- $f$ is decreasing in $B$ if:
$$x_1>x_2 \implies f(x_1)\geq f(x_2), \forall x_1,x_2 \in B$$
- $f$ is strictly decreasing in $B$ if:
$$x_1>x_2 \implies f(x_1)> f(x_2), \forall x_1,x_2 \in B$$

by the definition of [[derivative]] we can formally define a [[mathematical function]] increasing at a point if its [[derivative at a point]] (the given point) is positive and decreasing if its negative
