in [[trigonometry]], the cosine is a [[trigonometric function]] of an angle
the sine of an acute angle is defined in the context of a [[right triangle]]: for the specified angle, it is the ratio of the length of the side that is opposite that angle, to the length of the [[hypotenuse]], for any angle $x$, the cosine [[mathematical function]] is denoted simply as $cos x$

the definition of cosine can be extended to the [[real number]]s in terms of the length of a certain line segment in a [[unit circle]]

- right-angled triangle definition
the cosine function of a [[right triangle]] of sides $A,B,C$ and angles $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$, where $c$ is the right angle and  $C$ the [[hypotenuse]] is defined as the length of the adjacent side, divided by the length of the [[hypotenuse]]:
$$cos(\alpha)=\frac{B}{C}$$

- [[unit circle]] definition
let a line through the origin, intersect the unit circle, making an angle of $\theta$ with the positive half of the x-axis. the coordinates $x,y$ of the intersection point are equal to $cos(\theta )$, $sin(\theta )$, respectively 
this definition is consistent with the right-angled triangle definition of [[sine]] when $0º<\theta <90ª$: because the length of the hypotenuse is always 1:
$cos(\theta )=\frac{adjacent}{hypothenuse}=\frac{adjacent}{1}= adjacent$
the length of the opposite side of the triangle is simply the $x$ coordinate

- the [[domain]] of the [[mathematical function]] $cos(x)$ is $\mathbb{R}$, the [[real number]]s
- the [[image]] of $cos(x)$ is $[-1,1]$
- it is an [[even function]]
- it is a [[periodic function]] with [[period]] $2\pi$
