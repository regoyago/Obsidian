in mathematics, a unit cicle is a [[circle]] of the unit [[radius]] (generally 1)
frequently, specially in [[trigonometry]], the unit circle is the circle of radius 1 centered at the origin (0,0) in the [[cartesian coordinate system]]

given a point $(x,y)$ in the unit circle's [[circumference]], then $|x|$ and $|y|$ are the lengths of the legs of a [[right triangle]] whose [[hypotenuse]] has length 1, thus, by the [[pythagorean theorem]], $x$ and $y$ satisfy that $x^2+ y^2=1$
