in mathematics, trigonometric identities are equalities that involve [[trigonometric function]]s and are true to every value of the occurring variables
geometrically, a trigonometric identity is a kind of [[mathematical identity]] that involves a [[mathematical function]] of one or more angles

notation: greek letters for any [[angle]],  [[degree]] and [[radian]] are used as measurement

in [[trigonometry]], the basic relationship between the sine and the cosine is given by the pythagorean identity:
 $$sin^2 \theta + cos ^2 \theta = 1$$
this can be viewed as a version of the [[pythagorean theorem]], and follow from the [[mathematical equation]] $x^2+y^2=1$ for the [[unit circle]]
this equation can be solved for either the [[sine]] or [[cosine]]:
$sin\theta = \pm \sqrt{(1-cos^2 \theta)}$
$cos \theta = \pm \sqrt{(1-sin^2 \theta)}$

dividing this identity by either $sin^2\theta$ or $cos^2\theta$ yields the other two pythagorean identities:
$$1+cot^2 \theta = csc^2\theta$$

$$tan^2\theta + 1 = sec^2 \theta$$
