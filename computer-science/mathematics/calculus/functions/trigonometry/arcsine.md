the arc-sine is a [[trigonometric function]] defined as the [[inverse]] [[mathematical function]] of the  [[sine]]

$$y = arcsin(x) \iff sin(y)= x$$

since the sine is not a one-to-one function, it must be restricted[^1:] in order for its inverse to exist, therefore, the result ranges of the inverse functions are proper [[subset]]s of the [[domain]]s of the original functions

- the domain of arcsine is $[-1,1]$
- the range of usual principal values of inverse is $[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}]$
