the arc-sine is a [[trigonometric function]] defined as the [[inverse]] [[mathematical function]] of the  [[tangent]]

$$y = arctan(x) \iff tan(y)= x$$

since the [[tangent]] is not a one-to-one function, it must be restricted[^1:] in order for its inverse to exist, therefore, the result ranges of the inverse functions are proper [[subset]]s of the [[domain]]s of the original functions

- the domain of arctan is $\mathbb{R}$
- the range of usual principal values of inverse is $[0,\pi]$
