in [[trigonometry]], the cosecant is a [[trigonometric function]] of an angle
the sine of an acute angle is defined in the context of a [[right triangle]]: for the specified angle, it is the ratio of the length of the [[hypotenuse]], to the length of the side that is opposite that angle, that is to say that the [[cosecant]] is the [[multiplicatreive ciprocal quantity]] for any angle $x$, of the [[sine]], this [[mathematical function]] is denoted simply as $csc x$

the definition of cosecant can be extended to the [[real number]]s

- right-angled triangle definition
the sine function of a [[right triangle]] of sides $A,B,C$ and angles $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$, where $c$ is the right angle and  $c$ the [[hypotenuse]] is defined as the length of the [[hypotenuse]] , divided by the length of the opposite side:
$$csc(\alpha)=\frac{C}{A}$$


- the [[domain]] of the [[mathematical function]] $csc(x)$ is $\mathbb{R}\backslash \{x/ sin(x)=0 \}$
- the [[image]] of $sin(x)$ is $\mathbb{R}-[-1,1]$
- it is a [[periodic function]] with [[period]] $2\pi$
