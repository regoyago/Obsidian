in [[trigonometry]], the law of sines, sine law, sine formula or sine rule is an [[mathematical equation]] relating the lengths of the sides of a [[triangle]] to the [[sine]]s of its angles, according to the law:
$$\frac{a}{sin A}=\frac{b}{sin B}=\frac{c}{sin C} = 2R$$

where $a,b$ and $c$ are the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and $A,B$ and $C$ are the opposite angles, while $R$ is the [[radius]] of the triangles [[circumference]]

when the last part of the equation is not used, the law is sometimes stated using the reciprocals:
$$\frac{sin A}{a}=\frac{sin B}{b}=\frac{sin C}{c}$$

the law of sines can be used to compute the remaining sides of a triangle when two angles and a side are known[^1]

this law can be generalized to higher dimensions on surfaces with constant curvature


- Proof:
	the area $T$ of any triangle can be written as one half of its base times its height, selecting one side of the triangle as its base, the height of the triangle relative to that base is computed as the length of another side times the sine of the angle between the chosen side and the base
	thus, depending on the selection of the base, the area of the triangle can be written as:
	$$T=\frac{1}{2}b(c sin A)= \frac{1}{2}c (a sin B) = \frac{1}{2}a (b sin C)$$
	multiplying by $\frac{2}{abc}$:
	$$\frac{2T}{abc}=\frac{sinA}{a}=\frac{sinB}{b}=\frac{sinC}{c}$$
