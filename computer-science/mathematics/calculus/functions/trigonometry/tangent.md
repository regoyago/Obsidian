in [[trigonometry]], the tangent is a [[trigonometric function]] of an angle
the tangent of an acute angle is defined in the context of a [[right triangle]]: for the specified angle, it is the ratio of the length of the side that is opposite that angle, to the length of the adjacent side, for any angle $x$, the tangent [[mathematical function]] is denoted simply as $tan x$

the definition of tangent can be extended to the [[real number]]s in terms of the length of a certain line segment in a [[unit circle]]

- right-angled triangle definition
the tangent function of a [[right triangle]] of sides $A,B,C$ and angles $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$, where $c$ is the right angle and  $c$ the [[hypotenuse]] is defined as the length of the opposite side, divided by the length of the adjacent:
$$sin(\alpha)=\frac{A}{B}$$

- [[trigonometry]] definition
the tangent can be easily defined as the result of dividing the [[sine]] by the [[cosine]]

- [[unit circle]] definition
let a line through the origin, intersect the unit circle, making an angle of $\theta$ with the positive half of the x-axis. 
the intersection of this line with the line tangent to the unit circle on $(1,0)$ marks the value of the tangent[^1]
this definition is consistent with the right-angled triangle definition 


- the [[domain]] of the [[mathematical function]] $tan(x)$ is $\mathbb{R}\backslash \{\frac{\pi}{2}+k\pi:k\in \mathbb{Z}\}$
- the [[image]] of $tan(x)$ is $\mathbb{R}$
- it is an [[odd function]]
- it is a [[periodic function]] with [[period]] $\pi$



[^1]: take into account that, since the second line is always, vertical, any point resulting of its intersection will always be of the form $(1,y)$, hence, the value of $tan(\alpha)$ will be stored on the $y$ coordinate of the intersection
