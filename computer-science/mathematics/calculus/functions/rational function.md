a rational function is a [[mathematical function]] which is a quotient of [[polynomial function]]s, namely:  
  
$$f(x)=\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$$  
  
the [[domain]] of these functions are the whole [[real number]] set, except those points where the denominator is zero:  
$$Dom(f)=\mathbb{R}\\ {x\in \mathbb{R}; q(x)=0}$$
