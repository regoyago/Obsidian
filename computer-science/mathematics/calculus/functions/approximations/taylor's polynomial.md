in mathematics, the taylor's series of a [[mathematical function]] is an infinite sum of terms that are expressed in terms of the function's [[derivative]]s at a single point  
for most functions, the function and the sum of its taylor's series are equal near this point  
  
the partial sum formed by the first $n+1$ terms of a taylor's series is a [[polynomial function]] of degree $n$ that is called the taylor's polynomial of the function  
taylor's polynomials are approximations of a function, which become generally better as $n$ increases  
  
the taylor's series of a [[mathematical function]] over the [[real number]]s or over the [[complex number]]s $f(x)$ that is an infinitely[[differentiable function]] at a [[real number]] or a [[complex number]] $a$ is the power series:  
  
$$f(a)+\frac{f'(a)}{1!}(x-a)+\frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2+\frac{f'''(a)}{3!}(x-a)^3+\ldots$$  
  
where $n!$ denotes the [[factorial]] of $n$ this series can also be expressed as:  
  
$$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)(a)}}{n!}{(x-a)}^n$$  
  
where $f^{(n)}$ denotes the nth [[derivative]] of $f$ evaluated at the point $a$
