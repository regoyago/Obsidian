in numerical analysis, polynimial interpolation is the interpolation of a given data set by the [[polynomial]] of lowest possible degree that passes through the points of the dataset

formally:
given a set of $n+1$ data points $(x_0,y_0),\ldots,(x_n,y_n)$, with no two $x_j$ the same, a polynomial function $p(x)$ is said to interpolate the data if $p(x_j)=y_j$ for each $j\in \{0,1,\ldots ,n\}$

two common explicit formulas for this polynomial are the [[lagrange's interpolation]] and [[newton polynomial]]
