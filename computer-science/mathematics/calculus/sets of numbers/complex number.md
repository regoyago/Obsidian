a complex number is a [[number]] that can be expressed in the form $a+bi$ where $a$ and $b$ are [[real number]]s and $i$ is a symbol that represent the [[imaginary unit]]  
  
for any complex number, $a$ is called the real part and $b$ the imaginary part  
  
it is useful to think of the real numbers as all possible values in an infinitely big plane, generally referred to as the complex plane  
  
  
the [[set]] of complex numbers is denoted by $\mathbb C$  
and it contains all [[real number]] and [[imaginary number]]: $(\mathbb R \subset \mathbb C) \wedge (\mathbb I \subset\mathbb C)$
