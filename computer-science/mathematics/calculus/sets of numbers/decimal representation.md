a decimal representation of a non-negative [[real number]] $r$ is an expression in the form of a sequence of decimal digits, traditionally written with a single separator  
$$r=b_kb_{k-1}\ldots b_0.a_1a_2\ldots ,$$  
where $k$ is a non-negative [[integer number]] and $b_0,\ldots , b_k,a_1,a_2,\ldots$ are integers in the range $[0,\ldots ,9]$ which are called the digits of the representation  
this expression represents the infinite sum:  
  
$$r=\sum ^k_{i=0}b_i10^i + \sum ^\inf_{i=1}\frac{a_i}{10^i}$$  
the sequence of the $a_i$ -the digits after the dot- may be finite, in which case the lacking digits are assumed to be 0
