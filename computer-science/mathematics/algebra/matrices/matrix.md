in mathematics, a matrix is a rectangular [[array]] or table of numbers, symbols or [[expression]]s, arranged in rows and columns

without further specifications, matrices represent [[linear map]]s and allow explicit computations in [[linear algebra]][^1]
therefore, the study of matrices is a large part of linear algebra and most properties and operations of abstract linear algebra can be expressed in terms of matrices

[^1]: not all matrices are related to linear algebra, a [[adjacency matrix]] is an example of this
