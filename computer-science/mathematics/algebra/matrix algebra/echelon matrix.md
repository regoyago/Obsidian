in linear algebra, a [[matrix]] is in echelon form if it has the shape resulting from [[gaussian elimination]], that is:
- all rows consisting of only zeroes are at the bottom
- the [[pivot]] of a non-zero row is always strictly to the right of the leading coefficient of the row above it 

the following matrix is an example:
$$\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 & 5 & 1 \\
0 & 2 & 3 & 3 \\
0 & 0 & 2 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 
\end{pmatrix}$$
