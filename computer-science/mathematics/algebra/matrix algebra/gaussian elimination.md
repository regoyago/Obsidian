in mathematics, gaussian elimination, also known as row reduction, is an [[algorithm]] for solving [[linear system]]s
it consists of a sequence of operations performed on the corresponding [[matrix]] of coefficients
this method can also be used to compute the [[rank]] of a matrix, the [[determinant]] of a [[square matrix]], and the inverse of an [[invertible matrix]]

to perform row reduction on a matrix, one uses a sequence of [[linear system elementary operation]]
using these operations, a matrix can always be transformed into an [[upper triangular matrix]], and in fact one that is a [[echelon matrix]], once all of the leading coefficients are 1 and every column containing a leading coefficient has zeros elsewhere, the matrix is said to be a [[row canonical matrix]]
