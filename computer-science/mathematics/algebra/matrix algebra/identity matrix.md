in linear algebra, the identity matrix of size $n$ is the $n\times n$ [[square matrix]] with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere

it is often denoted by $I_n$ or simply $I$

$$I_1 = (1), \ \ I_2 = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1  
\end{pmatrix}, \ \ I_3=\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0 \\0&1&0\\0&0&1\end{pmatrix},\ldots$$
$$I_n = \begin{pmatrix}1&0&0&\ldots&0 \\0&1&0&\ldots&0\\0&0&1&\ldots&0\\\vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\0&0&0&\ldots&1
\end{pmatrix}$$
when $A$ is an $m\times n$ [[matrix]], it is a property of [[matrix multiplication]] that
$$I_m=A = AI_n = A$$
in particular, the identity matrix serves as the [[identity element]] of the matrix [[mathematical ring]] of all $n\times n$ matrices and as the [[identity element]] of the general linear group $GL(n)$, which consists of all [[invertible matrix]] under the matrix multiplication

when $n\times n$ matrices are used to represent [[linear transformation]]s form an $n$-dimensional [[vector space]] to itself, the identity matrix represents the [[identity function]], for whatever basis was used in this representation

the $i$th column of an identity matrix is the unit vector $e_i$
the [[determinant]] of any identity matrix is $1$
the [[rank]] of an identity matrix $I_n$ equals the size $n$
