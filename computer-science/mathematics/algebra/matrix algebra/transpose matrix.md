in linear algebra, the transpose of a [[matrix]] is an operator which flips a matrix over its diagonal[^1] 

formally, the $i$-th row, $j$-th column element of $A^T$ is the $j$-th row, $i$-th column element of $A$:
$$[A]_{ij} =[A^T]_{ji}$$

[^1]: practically ,this implies switching the row and column indices of the matrix
