in linear algebra the cofactor matrix of a matrix $A$ is another [[matrix]] $C$ where on each position the value is the cofactor value of $A$
being a cofactor  on position $i,j$ of $A$, defined formally as  $$C_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j} det A_{ij}$$
then the matrix would be expressed as:
$$C =\begin{pmatrix}
C_{1,1} & C_{1,2} & \cdots & C_{1,n} \\
C_{2,1} & C_{2,2} & \cdots & C_{2,n} \\
\vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
C_{m,1} & C_{m,2} & \cdots & C_{m,n} 
\end{pmatrix}$$
