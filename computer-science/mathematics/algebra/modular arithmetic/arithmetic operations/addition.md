in arithmetic, addition, denoted by the symbol $+$ is the most basic operation
in its simple form, addition combines two numbers into a single number 
adding finitely many numbers can be viewed as repeated simple addition; this is known as summation[^1]

the addition is [[conmutative]] and [[associative]], so the order in which finitely many terms are added does not matter

[^1]: this expression is also used to denote the definition of adding infinitely many numbers in an [[infinite series]]
