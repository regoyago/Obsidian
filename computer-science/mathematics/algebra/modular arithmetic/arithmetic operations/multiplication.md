in arithmetic, subtraction, denoted as $\times$, is the second basic operation of arithmetic, it combines  two numbers into a single number:
it can be viewed as a scaling operation, if the numbers are imagined as lying in a line, multiplying by a number greater than 1 is the same as stretching everything away from 0 uniformly in such a way that the number 1 is where the wanted number was

multiplication is [[associative]] and [[commutative]], as well as [[distributive]] over addition and subtraction
the multiplicative identity is $1$, and the multiplicative inverse of any number is the [[reciprocal number]] of this number
