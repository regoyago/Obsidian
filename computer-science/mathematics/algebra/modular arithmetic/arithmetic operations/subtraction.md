in arithmetic, subtraction, denoted as $-$, is the inverse operation to addition: it finds the difference between two numbers, $D = M - S$ that is to say that de difference is the number that, when added to the subtrahend, results in the minuend $D+S = M$

for positive arguments, $M, S$ holds:
- if the minuend is larger that the subtrahend, the difference $D$ is positive
- if the minuend is smaller than the subtrahend, the difference $D$ is negative

subtraction is neither [[conmutative]] nor [[associative]], for that reason, the construction of this reverse operation in modern algebra is often discarded in favor of introducing the concept off inverse elements where subtraction is regarded as adding the additive inverse of the subtrahend
