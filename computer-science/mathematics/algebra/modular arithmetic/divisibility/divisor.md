in mathematics, a divisor of an [[integer number]] $n$, also called a factor of $n$, is another integer $m$ that may be multiplied by some integer to produce $n$
in this case, one also says that $n$ is a multiple of $m$

an integer $n$ is divisible or evenly divisible by another integer $m$ if $m$ is a divisor of $n$; [[division]] of $n$ by $m$ leaves no remainder

the following lemma can be stated:
-  if $d$ is a non-zero integer such that $d|a$ and $d|b$  for $a,b$ integers, then for any integer $r,s$, $d|r\times a + s\times b$ in particular, $d|(a+b) and d|(a-b)$
	- proof:$$If = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}
        d|a \Rightarrow \exists q_1 \in \mathbb{Z}; a=dq_1 \Rightarrow ra=rdq_1\\d|b \Rightarrow \exists q_2 \in \mathbb{Z}; b=dq_2 \Rightarrow sb=sdq_2 
    \end{array}\right\} \Rightarrow ra+sb=d \overbrace{(rq_1+srq_2)}^{\in\mathbb{Z}}$$ hence, $d|(ra+sb)$
