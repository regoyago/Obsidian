a linear diophantine equation of two variables is an [[equation]] of the form  
$$ax+by=n *$$where $a$,$b$,$n$ are [[integer number]]s and $x$,$y$ are variables  
a solution of * is any couple ($x_0,y_0$)$\in \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ satisfying $ax_0 + by_0 = n$  
  
to decide when * admits a solution:  
- the diophantine equation $ax+by=n$ admits a solution if and only if the [[greatest common divisor]] of $a.b$ is a [[divisor]] of $n$  
moreover, if ($x_0,y_0$) is a solution, then all the solutions are of the form:  
$$(x_t,y_t)=\left( x_0+\frac{b}{gdc(a,b)}.t, \ \ \ \ y_0-\frac{a}{gcd(a,b)}t\right).t\in \mathbb{Z}$$
