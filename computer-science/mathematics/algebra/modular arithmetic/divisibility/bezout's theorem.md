in elementary [[number theory]], bézout's identity is the following theorem:  
let $a$ and $b$ be [[integer number]]s [[greatest common divisor]] $d$. then there exist integers $x$ and $y$ such that $ax + by = d$. More generally, the integers of the form $ax + by$ are exactly the multiples of $d$  
  
here the greatest common divisor of $0$ and $0$ is taken to be $0$. The integers _x_ and _y_ are called **bézout coefficients** for (_a_, _b_); they are not unique.  
a pair of bézout coefficients can be computed by the [[euclidean algorithm]] and this pair is one of the two pairs such that $| x | ≤ | b / d |$ and $| y | ≤ | a / d |$ .  
an equality may occur only if one of _a_ and _b_ is a multiple of the other.
