in arithmetic, a prime number is a [[natural number]] greater than 1 that is not the result of a [[multiplication]] of two smaller [[natural number]]s

the property of being prime is called primality  and there are several options to try and check this property but the general solution is still an open question

the prime numbers yield the following elementary operations:
- unique [[factorisation]] [^1] : any number can be expressed as an unique multiplication of prime numbers 
- infinitude: there are infinitely many prime numbers
