in computing, the modulo operation returns the remainder or signed remainder of a [[division]], after one number is divided by another

given two positive numbers $a$ and $n$, $a \ mod \ n$ is the remainder of the [[euclidean division]] of $a$ by $n$ 

although typically performed only with integers, many computing systems now allow other types of numeric operands
