in mathematics, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that every [[integer number]] greater than $1$ can be represented uniquely as a [[multiplication]] of [[prime number]]s, up to the order of factors
the requirement that the factors be prime is necessary
this theorem is the main reason why 1 is not considered a prime number: if it were prime, then factorisation into primes would not be unique
