in mathematics, a [[set]] $B$ of [[vector]]s in a [[vector space]] $V$ is called a bass if every element of $V$ may be written in a unique way as a finite [[linear combination]] of elements in $B$

the coefficients of this linear combination are referred to as components or coordinates of the vector with respect to $B$, and the elements of a basis are called basis vectors

equivalently, a set $B$ is a basis if its elements display [[linear independence]] and every element of $V$ is a linear combination of elements of $B$, in other words, a basis is a linearly independent [[linear span]] 

a vector may have several bases but all the bases must have the same number of elements, called the [[vector space dimension]]

properties:
let $V$ a vector space and $B={v_1,\ldots,v_n}$ a basis for $V$, then:
- every [[subset]] of $V$ with more than $n$ elements is linearly dependent
- every subset of $V$ with less that $n$ elements cannot generate $V$
if the dimension of the vector space is already known:
- if $S\subset V$ is a set of generators with exactly $n$ elements, then $S$ is a basis for $V$
- if $S'\subset V$ is a set that displays [[linear independence]] with exactly $n$ elements, then $S'$ is a basis for $V$
