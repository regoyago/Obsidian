in linear algebra, the  rank of a [[matrix]] is the dimension of the [[vector space]] spanned by its columns
this corresponds to the maximal number of columns of $A$ that show [[linear independence]]
this, in turn, is identical to the dimension of the [[vector space]] spanned by its rows

rank is thus a measure of the nondegenerateness of a [[linear system]] and [[linear transformation]] encoded by $A$ 

it is generally denoted by $rk(A)$

a fundamental result in linear algebra is that the column and the row rank are always equal

a matrix is said to have full rank if its rank equals the largest possible for a matrix of the same dimensions, which is the lesser of the number of rows and columns
