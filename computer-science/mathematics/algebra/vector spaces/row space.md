in linear algebra, the column space (also called range or image) of a [[matrix]] $A$ is the [[linear span]] of its column [[vector]]s

the column space of a matrix is the image or range of the corresponding [[linear transformation]]

formally:
let $\mathbb{F}$ be a [[mathematical field]] and $A$ an $m\times n$ matrix, with row vectors $v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n$, a [[linear combination]] of these is any vector of the form $$c_1v_1+c_2v_2+\ldots+c_nv_n$$ where $c_1,\ldots,c_n$ are scalars
the set of all possible linear combinations of $v_1,\ldots,v_n$ is called the row space of $A$, that is, the [[linear span]] of the vectors $v_1,\ldots, v_n$

for a matrix that represents a homogeneous [[linear system]], the row space consists of all linear equations that follow from those in the system

the rows of $A$ span the row space but they may not form a [[vector space basis]], if the row vectors do not show [[linear independence]]
multiplication by any [[elementary matrix]] does not affect  the row vectors [^1]
