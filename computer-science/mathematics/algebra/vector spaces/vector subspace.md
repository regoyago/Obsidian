in mathematics, more specifically linear algebra, a liner subspace,also known as vector subspace, is a [[vector space]] that is a [[subset]] of some larger vector space 

formally:
if $V$ is a vector space over a [[mathematical field]] $K$ and $W$ is a subset of $V$, then $W$ is a linear subspace of $V$ under the operations off $V$ over $K$
the following properties must be met in order for this to be true:
- the zero vector of $V$ is in $W$
- $\forall u,v \in W$, $u+v\in W$, that is, it is closed under addition
- $\forall u\in W, \lambda \in \mathbb{K}$, $\lambda \times u\in W$ that is, it is closed under scalar product
