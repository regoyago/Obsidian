in mathematics, the dimension of a [[vector space]] $V$ is the [[cardinality]] of a [[vector space basis]]  of $V$ over its base [[mathematical field]]

for every vector space there exists a basis and all bases of a vector space have equal cardinality, as a result, the dimension of a vector space is uniquely defined

the dimension of the vector space $V$ over the field $F$ can be written as $dim_F(V)$ or as $[V:F]$, read "dimension of $V$ over $F$"
