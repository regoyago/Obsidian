in coding theory, a linear code is an error correcting code for which any [[linear combination]] of [[codeword]]s is also a codeword

linear codes are traditionally partitioned into block codes and 

formally, a linear code of length $n$ and rank $k$ is a [[vector subspace]] $C$ of dimension $k$ of the [[vector space]] $\mathbb{F}_q^n$, where $F_q$ is the finite [[mathematical field]] with $q$ elements
such a code is a $q$-ary code

the [[vector]]s in $C$ are called codewords and the size of a code is the number of codewords and equals $q^k$

as the vector subspace of $\mathbb{F}^n_q$, the entire code $C$ may be represented as the [[linear span]] of a [[set]] of $k$ codewords, ([[vector space basis]])
these basis codewords are often collated in the rows of a [[matrix]] $G$ known as a [[generating matrix]] for the code $C$
