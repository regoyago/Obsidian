in coding theory, the dual code of a [[linear code]]
$$C\subset\mathbb{F}^n_q$$
is the linear code defined by 
$$C^{\bot}=\{x\in\mathbb{F}^n_q|\langle x,c \rangle = 0 \forall c \in C \}$$
where $$\langle x,c \rangle =\sum ^n_{i=1} x_ic_i$$is a scalar product

the dimension of $C$ and its dual always add up to the length $n$
$$dimC +dimC^\bot=n$$

a [[generating matrix]] for the dual code is the [[parity check matrix]] for the original code and vice versa
