in coding theory, a systematic code is any error-correcting code in which the input data is embedded in the encoded output

systematic codes have the advantage that the parity data can simply be appended to the source block, and receivers do not need to recover the original source symbols if received correctly

any non-systematic linear code can be transformed into a systematic code with essentially the same properties  
for a systematic [[linear code]], the [[generating matrix]] $G$, can always be written as $G=[I_k|P]$, where $I_k$ is the [[identity matrix]] of size $k$
