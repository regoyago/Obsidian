in mathematics, rings are algebraic structures that generalise [[mathematical field]]: multiplication need not be [[commutative]] and [[inverse element]] for multiplication does not exist

in other words, a ring is a [[set]] equipped with two [[binary mathematical function]]s satisfying properties analogous to those of [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] of [[integer number]]s 

ring elements may be numbers or non-numerical objects such as[[polynomial]]s, [[square matrix]], [[mathematical function]]s...
