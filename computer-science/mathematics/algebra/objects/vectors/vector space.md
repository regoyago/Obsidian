in mathematics a vector space or linear  space is a [[set]] of objects called [[vector]]s,  which may be added or "scaled" multiplying them by a scalar from any [[mathematical field]]

vector spaces are the subject of linear algebra and are well characterised by their [[dimension]], which specifies the number of independent directions in the space

formally:
a vector space over a [[mathematical field]] $F$ is a [[set]] with two [[binary mathematical function]]s
- the first operation, called addition or simply addition $+ : V\times V\rightarrow V$[^1] assigns to any two vectors $v$ and $w$ in $V$, a third vector in $V$, commonly written as $v+w$, the sum of the two previous
- the second operation, scalar multiplication $f\times V\rightarrow V$, assigns  to any scalar $a$ in $F$ and any vector $v \in V$, another vector in $V$, denoted as $aV$[^2] 

all operations defined over a vector space must satisfy the following [[axiom]]s:
- [[associative]] addition:
	$u+(v+w)=(u+v)+w$
- [[commutative]] addition:
	$u+v=v+u$
- [[identity element]] of addition:
  there exists an element $0\in V$, called the zero vector such that $v+0=v\ \forall v\in V$
- [[inverse element]] of the addition
  $\forall v\in V$, there exists an element $-v \in V$, such that $v+(-v)=0$
- compatibility of scalar multiplication and field multiplication
  $a(bv)=(ab)v$
- identity element of scalar multiplication
  $lv = v$ where l denotes the multiplicative [[identity element]] in $F$
- [[distributive property]] of scalar multiplication with respect to vector addition
  $a(u+v)=au+av$
- distributive property of scalar multiplication with respect to field addition
  $(a+b)v = av+bv$


vector spaces are the appropriate linear-algebraic notion to deal with [[linear system]]s 

[^1]: here $V\times V$ denotes the set of the [[ordered pair]]s of elements of $V$
[^2]: scalar multiplication is not to be confused with the [[scalar product]]
