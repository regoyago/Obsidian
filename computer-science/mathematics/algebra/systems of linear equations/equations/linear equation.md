in mathematics, a linear equation is a [[mathematical equation]] that may be put in the form 
$$a_1x_1+\ldots +a_nx_n +b = 0$$
where $x_1,\ldots x_n$ are the variables and $b,a_1,\ldots,a_n$ are the coefficients
and all this parameters are defined over some [[field]]

alternatively, we can also define a linear equation by equating to zero a linear [[polynomial]] over some field from which the coefficients are taken
