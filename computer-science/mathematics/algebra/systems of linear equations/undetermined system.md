in mathematics, a [[linear system]] is considered undetermined if there are fewer equations than unknowns 

a system's [[row canonical matrix]], if the system is undetermined will have more columns than rows
$$\left(\begin{array}{@{}cccc|c@{}}
1 & 3 & 2 & 6 & 1\\
0 & 1 & 4 & 3 & 2\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3
\end{array}\right)$$
if its coefficients are defined over $\mathbb{R}$, the solution is infinite, if they are over $\mathbb{Z}_b$ it will be finite
