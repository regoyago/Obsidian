in mathematics, specifically algebra, a [[linear system]] is called consistent if there is at least one [[set]] of values for the unknowns that satisfies each equation in the system: when substituted into each of the equations, they make each equation hold true as an identity

a system that is not consistent is called inconsistent

regardless of the consistency of a system, it can be [[overdetermined system]] or [[undetermined system]] 

formally, a linear system is said to be consistent if its [[matrix]] has the same [[rank]] as his augmented matrix[^1]

for example:
$$\left(\begin{array}{@{}cccc|c@{}}
1 & 3 & 2 & 6 & 1\\
0 & 1 & 4 & 3 & 2\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 
\end{array}\right)$$
is the [[row canonical matrix]] that represents a consistent system
