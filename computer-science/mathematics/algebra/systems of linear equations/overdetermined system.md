in mathematics, a [[linear system]] is considered undetermined if there are fewer unknowns than equations 

a system's [[row canonical matrix]], if the system is undetermined, will have more rows than columns 

$$\left(\begin{array}{@{}ccc|c@{}}
3 & 2 & 6 & 1\\
1 & 4 & 3 & 2\\
0 & 1 & 2 & 3\\
5 & 0 & 1 & 1 
\end{array}\right)$$
