machine learning is the study of computer [[algorithm]]s that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data 

it is generally perceives as a part of [[artificial intelligence]]

machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data known as [[training data]], in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so

machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks

a subset of machine learning is closely related to [[computational statistics]], which focuses on making predictions using computers; but not all machine learning is statistical.
the study of [[mathematical optimisation]] delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning 

some implementations of machine learning use data and [[artificial neural network]]s in a way that mimics the workings of the biological brain 

machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, depending on the nature of the "signal" or "feedback" available to the learning system:
- [[supervised learning]]: the computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by  a "teacher", and the goal is to learn a general rile that maps inputs to outputs
- [[unsupervised machine learning]]: no labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving on it own to find structure in its input, this kind of learning can be a goal in itself of a means towards an end
- [[reinforcement learning]]: a computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal, as it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximise
