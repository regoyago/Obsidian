in [[artificial intelligence]], an intelligent agent is anything which perceives its environment, takes actions autonomously in order to archive goals and may improve its performance with learning or may use knowledge 

artificial intelligence itself can be defined in terms of agents such as: "artificial intelligence is defined as the study and design of intelligent agents"

intelligent agents are often described schematically as an abstract functional system similar to a computer program
abstract definitions of intelligent agents have to be distinguished from real life implementation
that model can be represented as a function correlating precepts and actions$$f:P^*\rightarrow A$$

intelligent agents can be classified in 4 main types:
- [[simple reactive agent]]: the simplest, works on "reflex"
- [[model-based agent]]: maintains an internal state which stores the evolution of the world and the effect of each action on the world
- [[goal-based agent]]: knows a series of goals to be reached and plans the sequence of actions needed to reach the goals
- [[utility-based agent]]: each state has associated an utility value (desirability) of the value
