artificial intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by animals

leading artificial intelligence textbooks define the field as the study of [[intelligent agent]]s: any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximise its chance of achieving its goals

artificial intelligence was founded as an academic disciple in 1956 and experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and loss of founding
ai research has tried and discarded many different approaches since its founding, including [[symbolic artificial intelligence]] (imitating human problem solving using [[mathematical logic]])
in the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical-statistical [[machine learning]] has dominated the field

the various sub fields of ai research are centred around particular goals and the use of particular tools
being general intelligence one of the field's long term goals

the field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate", whether this statement is true or not yields several philosophical  questions
