artificial neural networks (ANNs) often simply called neural networks (NNs) are computing systems inspired by the biological neural network

an ANN is based in a collection of connected units or nodes called [[artificial neuron]]s, which loosely [[model]] the neurons in a biological brain 
those are generally aggregated into layers that may perform different transformations on their inputs
