in mathematics, a radial function is a [[mathematical function]] defined on an [[euclidean space]] $R^n$ whose value at each point depends only on the distance between that point and the origin

for example, for a radial function $\phi$ in two dimensions:
$$\phi (x,y) = \varphi (r), r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$
where $\varphi$ is a function of a single non-negative real variable

a function is radial if and only is it is invariant under all rotations leaving the origin fixed
