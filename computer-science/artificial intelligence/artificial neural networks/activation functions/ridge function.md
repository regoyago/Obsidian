in mathematics, a ridge function is a [[mathematical function]] $f: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ that can be written as the composition unvariate function with an affine transformation, that is: $f(x) = g(x\dot \ a)$ for some $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $a\in \mathbb{R}^d$

they are useful due to not being susceptible to the curse of dimensionality [^1] , making it an instrumental tool in various estimation problems

[^1]: the curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena that arise when analysing and organising data in high dimensional spaces that do not occur in low-dimensional settings
