in mathematical optimisation and computer science, heuristic is a technique designed for solving a problem more quickly, when classic methods are too slow, or for finding an approximate solution when classic methods fail to  
  
this is achieved by trading optimality, accuracy or precision, for speed  
it can be, in some way, considered a shortcut  
  
a heuristic function, also simply called a heuristic, is a [[mathematical function]] that ranks alternatives in [[search algorithm]]s at each branching step based in available information to decide which branch to follow  
  
heuristics may produce results by themselves or may be used in conjunction with optimisation algorithms to improve their efficiency  
  
results about [[NP-hardness]] in theoretical computer science make heuristics the only viable option for a variety of complex optimisation problems that need to be routinely solved in real-world applications  
  
heuristics underlie the whole field of [[artificial intelligence]] and the computer simulation of a thought process, as they may be used in situations where there are no known [[algorithms]]
