insertion sort is a simple [[sorting algorithm]] that builds the final sorted array or list one item at a time 

while much less efficient for big values of $n$ than [[quicksort]], [[heap sort]] or [[mergesort]], insertion sort still provides several advantages:
- simple implementation
- efficient for small data sets
- more efficient in practice than most other $O(n^2)$ algorithms such as [[selection sort]] or [[bubble sort]]
- it is adaptive
- stable: does not change relative order of elements with equal keys
- only requires $O(1)$ of additional memory space
