in computer science, a sorting algorithm is an [[algorithm]]  that puts elements of a [[list]] into [[total order]]

formally, the output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:
- the output's size is represented by a [[monotonic function]]
- the output is a [[permutation]] of the input
to garantee efficiency, the input data should be stored in a [[data structure]] which allows random access rather than sequential access
