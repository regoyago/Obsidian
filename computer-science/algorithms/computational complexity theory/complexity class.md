in [[computational complexity]] theory, a complexity class is a [[set]] of [[computational problems]] of related resource-based complexity

in general, a complexity class is defined in terms of a type of computational problem, a [[model of computation]], and a bounded resource
in particular, most complexity classes consist of decision problems that are solvable by a [[turing machine]], and differentiated by their rime or space requirements

the study of the relationships between complexity classes is a major area of research in theoretical computer science, moreover, it is known that a number of fundamental time and space complexity classes relate to each other as follows:

[[NL]] $\subseteq$ [[P]] $\subseteq$ [[NP]] $\subseteq$ [[PSPACE]] $\subseteq$ [[EXPTIME]] $\subseteq$ [[EXPSPACE]]

yet, many of these relationships are not specifically known [^1]

[^1]: a good example of this is the open problem [[P vs NP problem]]
