let $f$ and $g$ be [[mathematical function]]s, defined over the [[real number]]s, generally positive [[integer number]]s  
let both functions be defined on some unbounded [[subset]] of the positive [[real number]]s, and $g(x)$ be strictly positive for all large enough values of $x$  
one writes:  
$$f(x)=o (g(x)) \ \ \ \ \ \ x\to \infty$$  
  
if the [[absolute value]] of $f(x)$ is at most a positive constant multiple of $g(x)$ for all sufficiently large values of $x$, that is $f(x)=\omega(g(x))$ if for all positive real numbers $c$ and a real number $x_0$ such that $|f(x)|< c\ g(x) \ \ \ \ \forall x\geq x_0$  
  
that is to say, small o represents a strict upper bound of the [[mathematical function]] that represents the [[algorithm]]  
  
  
  
if the $o$ notation is true, then by definition:  
$o \implies O \wedge Â¬\Theta \implies O\wedge \Omega$  
  
moreover , it is true that $\lim_{n\to \infty}\frac{T(n)}{f(n)}=0$
