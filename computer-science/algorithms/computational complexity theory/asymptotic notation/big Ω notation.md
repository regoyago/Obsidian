let $f$ and $g$ be [[mathematical function]]s, defined over the [[real number]]s, generally positive [[integer number]]s 
let both functions be defined on some unbounded [[subset]] of the positive [[real number]]s, and $g(x)$ be strictly positive for all large enough values of $x$
one writes:
$$f(x)=\Omega (g(x)) \ \ \ \ \ \  x\to \infty$$

if the [[absolute value]] of $f(x)$ is at most a positive constant multiple of $g(x)$ for all sufficiently large values of $x$, that is $f(x)=\Omega(g(x))$ if there exists a positive real number $c$ and a real number $x_0$ such that $|f(x)|\geq c\ g(x) \ \ \ \ \forall x\geq x_0$ 

that is to say, big $\Omega$  represents a lower bound of the [[mathematical function]] that represents the [[algorithm]]
