asymptotic notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behaviour of a function when the argument leads towards a particular value or infinity

formally, given the [[mathematical function]]s $f(x), g(x)$, we define a [[binary relation]]
$$f(x) \tilde g(x) \ \ \ \ (as\ \ x \to \infty )$$
the relation is an [[equivalence relation]] on the [[set]] of functions of $x$; the functions $f$ and $g$ are said to be asymptotically equivalent

the [[domain]]  of $f$ and $g$ can be any set for which the limit is defined
