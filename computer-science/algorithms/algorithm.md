in mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation  
algorithms must be unambiguous and are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning....  
  
algorithms can be understood as a an [[abstract model]] above a computer program
