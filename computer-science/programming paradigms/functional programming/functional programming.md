in computer science, functional programming is a [[programming paradigm]] where programs are constructed by applying and composing [[subroutine]]s, also known as functions  
  
it is a [[declarative programming]] paradigm in which function definitions are [[tree]]s of expressions that [[map]] values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program  
  
functions are treated as first-class citizens, meaning that they can be bound to names. passed as [[argument]]s and returned form other functions, just as any other [[data type]]  
this allows programs to be written in a [[declarative programming]] and [[composable programming]] style where small functions are combined modularity  
  
functional programming is sometimes treated as a synonym to [[purely functional programming]], a subset of functional programming that treats all functions as [[deterministic]] [[mathematical function]]s  
  
functional programming evolved from [[lambda calculus]], a formal style of computation based purely on functions  
[[ocaml]], [[haskell]] or [[common lisp]] are some of the most known functional programming languages  
  
there are a number of concepts that, while not entirely exclusive to functional programming[ยน], they are closely related:  
- [[higher order function]]s: functions that can either take other functions as arguments, or return other functions  
- [[pure function]]s : [[subroutine]]s that have no side effects  
- [[recursion]]: similar in functionality as [[iteration]] in [[functional programming]]  
  
[^1]:programming languages often cater to several programming paradigms, so programmers are generally bound to intermix concepts from several paradigms on the same code
