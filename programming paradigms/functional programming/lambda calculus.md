lambda calculus, also written as $\lambda$-calculus, is a [[formal system]] in mathematical [[logic]] for expressing [[computation]] based on function [[abstraction]] and [[application]] using variable [[binding]] and [[substitution]]  
it is an universal [[model of computation]] that can be used to simulate any [[turing machine]]  
  
lambda calculus consists of constructing lambda terms and performing reduction operations on them  
  
  
lambda calculus is [[turing complete]], its namesake ($\lambda$) is used in lambda expressions and lambda terms to denote [[binding]] a variable in a [[subroutine]]  
  
lambda calculus may be untyped or typed:  
on [[typed lambda calculus]], functions can be applied only if they are capable of accepting the given inputs "type" of data, this kind of calculus is weaker than the untyped, in the sense that the former can express less than untyped calculus  
  
lambda calculus has applications in many different areas in mathematics, philosophy, linguistics and computer science  
it has played an important role in the development of the theory of programming languages  
[[functional programming]] languages implement lambda calculus  
it is a current research topic in [[category theory]]
