in computer science, purely functional programming usually designates a [[programming paradigm]] branching of [[functional programming]] that treats all computations as the evaluation of [[mathematical function]]s, also forbidding [[state change]]s and [[mutable]] data  
  
purely functional programming consists of ensuring that [[subroutine]]s, inside the functional paradigm will only depend on their arguments, regardless of any global or local state
