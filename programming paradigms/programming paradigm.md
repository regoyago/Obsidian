a programming paradigm is a classification of [[programming language]]s based on their features  
languages can be classified into multiple paradigms  
  
some paradigms are concerned mainly with implications for the [[execution model of a programming language]], such as allowing side effects, or whether the sequence of operation is defines by the execution model  
other paradigms are concerned with the way that the code is organized, such as grouping the code into units along with the state tat is modified by the code  
yet others are concerned mainly with the style of syntax and grammar  
  
common programming paradigms include  
- [[declarative programming]]: in which the programmer instruct the machine how to change its state  
- [[functional programming]]  
- [[logic programming]]  
- [[mathematical programming]]  
- [[reactive programming]]  
- [[imperative programming]]: in which the programmer declares properties of the desired result, not how to obtain it  
- [[procedural programming]]  
- [[object-oriented programming]]
