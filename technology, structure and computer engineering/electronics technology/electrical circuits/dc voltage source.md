a voltage source is a two-terminal device which can mantain a fixed [[electric potential]] independent of the current flow though them 
such voltage difference between its terminals is the electromotive force of the generator
the term voltage ([[electric potential]]) will be used, even though it would be more correct to denote it as electromotive force, since the role of the generator is to deliver the necessary energy to the charge carriers to complete the trajectoy without the circuit powered by the generator

the voltage inside the generator is denoted as $V_g$ and the voltage thoughout the circuit is $V$

in an ideal generator, both the electromotive force and the voltage between its terminals are the same $V_g=V$ 

a dc ideal voltage generator delivers power when current $I$ exits the generator through the $+$ terminal
- power dissipated by the load:  $P_{R_L} = I^2.R_L=V_g.I$
- power delivered by the generator: $P=V.I=V_g.I$
- total power developed by the generator: $P_g=V_g.I=V.I$


a dc ideal voltage generator consumes power when the [[electric current]] enters through the $+$ terminal
- power consumed by the generator (convention): $P_g=V_g.(-I)=-V_g.I=-V.I$

however, when working with a real voltage generator the voltage difference between the terminals depends on the current [[electric current intensity]] delivered by the generator
this way, the voltage across the generator terminals decreases as the current intensity delivered by such a generator increases
