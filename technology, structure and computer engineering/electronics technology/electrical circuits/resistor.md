a resistor is a [[passive electrical component]] that implements [[electrical resistance]] as a circuit element

resistors are used in [[electronic devices]] to reduce current flow, adjust signal leves, used as a [[voltage divider]], [[bias]] [[active elements]] and terminate [[transmission lines]]

a resistor will operate following [[ohm's law]], but it wil behave differently if its connected in [[series]] or in [[pararell]] with other resistors
- the total [[electrical resistance]] of resisitors connected in [[series]] is the sum of their individual resistance values    
$R_eq=R_1+R_2+\ldots +R_n$

- the total [[electrical resistance]] of resisitors connected in [[pararell]] is the sum of the reciprocals individual resistors
$\frac{1}{R_eq}=\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}+\ldots +\frac{1}{R_n}$
recalling the concept of [[electrical conductance]]
$G_eq=G_1+G_2+\ldots +G_n$

let $R$ be a resistor traversed by a current with an intensity $I$ form $a$ to $b$, then the voltage drop between its ends is $V = V_a-V_b$, where $V_a>V_b$, therefore, the power dissipated by the resistor is calculated as follows:

$$P_R=V.I=I^2.R=\frac{V^2}{R} \ \ W$$

this equation is known as [[joule's law]]
