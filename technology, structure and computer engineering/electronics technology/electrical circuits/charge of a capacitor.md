as the number of positive charges in one of the plates increase together with the number of negative charges in the other plate, an electric field~E appears between the two conductor plates, and therefore, a potential difference $V$ also appears. 
both the electric field and the potential difference increase proportionally to the amount of charge transferred from one plate to the other until an equilibrium is reached.  
such an equilibrium takes place when the potential difference between the plates of the capacitor is equal to that of the battery. in such a situation the battery have transferred a charge $+Q$ to the plate connected to its positive terminal, and a charge $−Q$ to the plate connected to the negative terminal of the battery. 
actually, the charge $+Q$ is due to the absence of electrons transferred to the other plate with charge $−Q$. 
therefore, both plates have the same amount of charge but with opposite sign, thus the total net charge of the capacitor is zero. this way, when we talk about the charge of a capacitor, we are referring to the charge of one of its two plates, and not to its total net charge.
if we charge a capacitor connecting it to a battery of $V$ 1 volts, then the capacitor is charged with $Q$ 1 coulombs. if it is charged using a battery of $V$ 2 volts, then a charge equal to $Q$ 2 coulombs is acquired, and if we use a battery of $V$ 3 volts, then the corresponding charge will be $Q$ 3. if we compute the relationship between $Q$ and $V$ for each of the previous cases, we observe that such a relationship is constant, independently from the voltage $V$. such a constant is known as the [[capacitance]] of the capacitor
