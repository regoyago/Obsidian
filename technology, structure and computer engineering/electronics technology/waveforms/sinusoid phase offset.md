$φ$ is the phase angle of the signal, which determines the value of the signal for $t= 0$. 
a change in the phase angle of the sinusoid shifts the signal along the time axis, but it does not impact on its amplitude $X_m$ nor its frequency $ω$
a positive value of $φ$ shifts the signal to the left hand side, whereas a negative value of $φ$ produces a shift to the right hand side. The phase shift $φ$ can be expressed in sexagesimal degrees $◦$ or in radians $[rad]$
