a [[sine]] [[waveform ]] or sinusoidal signal is a signal that varies  over time, describing a sinusoid It canbe expressed in terms of the sine (sin) or cosine (cos) function:
$$x(t)=X_msin(\omega t+  φ)$$
$$x(t)=X_mcos(\omega t+ φ)$$

given the immediate relationship between both functions ($cos(ωt) = sin(ωt+90◦)$), any of them is typically considered in practice. From now on we consider the sinefunction, but without forgetting that all derivations are equally valid if the [[cosine]] function is used instead

the parameters that define the above-mentioned signals are the following:
[[sinusoid instantaneous value]]
[[sinusoid period]]
[[sinusoid frequency]]
[[sinusoid peak value]]
[[sinusoid amplitude]]
[[sinusoid ripple]]
[[sinusoid average value]]
[[sinusoid phase offset]]
[[sinusoid root mean square value]]
