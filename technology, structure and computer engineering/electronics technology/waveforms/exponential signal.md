the exponential signal or [[exponential function]] , evolves from an initial value $A$ (when  $t=t_I$) towards zero following an exponentially decaying curve. 
hence, for $t>t_I$ the function is equal to the constant $A$ times the (also constant) Euler number $e$ (approximately equal to $2.71828$) to the power of the time-dependent exponent $−a·(t−t_I)$  where $a$ is also constant

$$x(t) = \begin{cases} 0 \ \ -\infty<t<t_I \\ A.e^{-a(t-t_I)}\ \ t_I\leq t < \infty \end{cases}$$
