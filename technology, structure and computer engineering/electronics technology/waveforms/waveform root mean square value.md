the root mean square value $X_{ef}$ or $X_{RMS}$, also known as the quadratic mean, is defined as the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of the instantaneous values of the signal during a [[waveform period]]

$$X_{ef}=X_{RMS}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\int_0^Tx^2(t)dt}$$

the RMS calue of an AC signal (voltage) corresponds to the value of a DC (constant) signal, so that boths dissipate the same power in a resistor
