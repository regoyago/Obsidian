[[complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)]] [[logic gates]], use complementary arrangements of enhancement-mode [[N-channel]] and [[P-channel]] [[field effect transistor]]

since the initial devices used oxide-isolated metal gates, they were called CMOS

in contrast to TTL, CMOS uses almost no power in the static state (that is, when inputs are not changing)

a CMOS gate draws no current other than leakage when in a steady 1 or 0 state
when the gate switches states, current is drawn from the power supply to charge the capacitance at the output of the gate
this means that the current draw of CMOS devices increases with switching rate (controlled by clock speed, typically)
