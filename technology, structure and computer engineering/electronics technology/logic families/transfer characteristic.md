the transfer characteristic is the graphical representation of the output voltage $V_o$ as a function of the input voltage $V_i$. 
once the feeding voltage, the ambient temperature and the number of gates of the same type have been established, the inputâ€“output voltages relationship $V_o=f(V_i)$ will be unique, except for the tolerances of the manufacturing process
